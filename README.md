### Requirements

On Linux (and other Unix-like systems, but not on OSX), a C and a C++ compiler is needed, and also the tool make. On Debian and Ubuntu Linux the build-essential package installs these.

### Optional requirements

On Linux (and other Unix-like systems, but not on OSX), the libxml2 library, including header files, is needed for the ability of reading GraphML files. On Ubuntu and Debian Linux the lixml2 and libxml2-dev packages are needed.
The tcltk R package is needed for tkplot and tkigraph to work.
The rgl R package is needed for rglplot to work.
The ape package is needed to plot nice dendrograms with plot_dendrogram
