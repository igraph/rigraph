La más sencilla es con la función make_empty_graph(): La forma más común de crear un grafo es con make_graph(), que construye un grafo basado en especificar las aristas. Por ejemplo, Para hacer un grafo con 10 nodos (numerados 1 10) y dos aristas que conecten los nodos 1-2 y 1-5: partir de igraph 0.8.0, también puedes incluir literales mediante la notación de fórmulas de igraph. En este caso, el primer término de la fórmula tiene que empezar con un carácter ~, como comúnmente se usa en las fórmulas en R. Las expresiones constan de los nombres de los vértices y los operadores de las aristas. El operador de un arista es una secuencia de caracteres - y +, el primero es para indicar propiamente las aristas y el segundo para las puntas de flecha (dirección). Puedes utilizar tantos caracteres - como quieras para “dibujarlas”. Si todos los operadores de un arista están formados únicamente por caracteres -, el grafo será dirigido, mientras que un único carácter + implica un grafo dirigido. Por ejemplo, para crear el mismo grafo que antes: Podemos imprimir el grafo para obtener un resumen de sus nodos y aristas: Esto significa: grafo dirigido (Undirected) con 10 vértices y 2 aristas, que se enlistan en la última parte. Si el grafo tiene un atributo [nombre], también se imprime. NOTA: summary() enlista las aristas, lo cual es conveniente para grafos grandes con millones de aristas: También make_graph() puede crear algunos grafos destacados con sólo especificar su nombre. Por ejemplo, puedes generar el grafo que muestra la red social del club de kárate de Zachary, que refleja la amistad entre los 34 miembros del club de una universidad de los Estados Unidos en la década de los 70s: Para observar un grafo puedes utilizar plot():  Más adelante en este tutorial se ofrece una descripción detallada de las opciones para graficar un grafo.","code":"g <- make_empty_graph() g <- make_graph(edges = c(1,2, 1,5), n=10, directed = FALSE) g <- make_graph(~ 1--2, 1--5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) g ## IGRAPH 25da3d2 UN-- 10 2 --  ## + attr: name (v/c) ## + edges from 25da3d2 (vertex names): ## [1] 1--2 1--5 summary(g) ## IGRAPH 25da3d2 UN-- 10 2 --  ## + attr: name (v/c) g <- make_graph(\"Zachary\") plot(g)"},{"path":"https://r.igraph.org/articles/igraph_ES.html","id":"ids-de-vértices-y-aristas","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"IDs de vértices y aristas","title":"igraph (interfaz R)","text":"Los vértices y las aristas tienen un identificador numérico en igraph. Los ID de los vértices son siempre consecutivos y empiezan por 1. Para un grafo con “n” vértices, los ID de los vértices están siempre entre 1 y “n”. Si alguna operación cambia el número de vértices en los grafos, por ejemplo, se crea un subgrafo mediante induced_subgraph(), entonces los vértices se vuelven enumerar para satisfacer este criterio. Lo mismo ocurre con las aristas: los ID de las aristas están siempre entre 1 y “m”, el número total de aristas del grafo. NOTA: Si estás familiarizado con C o con la interfaz Python de igraph, te habrás dado cuenta de que en esos lenguajes los IDs de vértices y aristas empiezan por 0. En la interfaz de R, ambos empiezan por 1, para mantener la coherencia con la convención de cada lenguaje. Además de los IDs, los vértices y aristas se les puede asignar un nombre y otros atributos. Esto facilita su seguimiento cada vez que se altera un grafo. Más adelante en este tutorial se muestran ejemplos de cómo alterar estas características.","code":""},{"path":"https://r.igraph.org/articles/igraph_ES.html","id":"añadir-y-borrar-vértices-y-aristas","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Añadir y borrar vértices y aristas","title":"igraph (interfaz R)","text":"Sigamos trabajando con el grafo del club de kárate. Para añadir uno o más vértices un grafo existente, utiliza add_vertices(): Del mismo modo, para añadir aristas puedes utilizar add_edges(): Las aristas se añaden especificando el ID del vértice origen y el vértice destino de cada arista. Con las instrucciones anteriores se añaden tres aristas, una que conecta los vértices 1 y 35, otra que conecta los vértices 1 y 36 y otra que conecta los vértices 34 y 37. Además de las funciones add_vertices() y add_edges(), se puede utilizar el operador “+” para añadir vértices o aristas al grafo. La operación que se realice dependerá del tipo de argumento del lado derecho: Puedes añadir un solo vértice/arista la vez usando add_vertex() y add_edge() (singular). Advertencia: Si necesitas añadir múltiples aristas un grafo, es mucho más eficiente usar add_edges() una vez que utilizar repetidamente add_edge() con una nueva arista la vez. Lo mismo ocurre al eliminar aristas y vértices. Si intentas añadir aristas vértices con IDs válidos (por ejemplo, intentas añadir una arista al vértice 38 cuando el grafo sólo tiene 37 vértices), igraph muestra un error: Añadamos más vértices y aristas nuestro grafo. En igraph podemos utilizar el paquete magrittr, que proporciona un mecanismo para encadenar comandos con el operador %>%: Ahora tenemos un grafo dirigido con 40 vértices y 89 aristas. Los IDs de los vértices y aristas son siempre contiguos, así que si borras un vértice, todos los vértices subsecuentes se vuelven enumerar. Cuando se re-numera un vértice, las aristas se vuelven enumerar, pero sí sus vértices origen y destino. Puedes usar delete_vertices() y delete_edges() para realizar estas operaciones. Por ejemplo, para borrar la arista que conecta los vértices 1-34, obtén su ID y luego bórrala: Por ejemplo, para crear un grafo con forma de anillo y para partirlo:  El ejemplo anterior muestra que también puedes referirte las aristas indicando los IDs de los vértices origen y destino, conectados por el símbolo |. En el ejemplo, \"10|1\" significa la arista que conecta el vértice 10 con el vértice 1. Por supuesto, también puedes usar los IDs de las aristas directamente, o recuperarlos con la función get_edge_ids():  Veamos otro ejemplo, hagamos un grafo cordal. Recuerda que un grafo es cordal (o triangulado) si cada uno de sus ciclos de cuatro o más nodos tienen una “cuerda”, que es una arista que une dos nodos que son adyacentes en el ciclo. En primer lugar, vamos crear el grafo inicial utilizando graph_from_literal():  En este ejemplo, se ha utilizado el operador : para definir conjuntos de vértices. Si el operador de un arista conecta dos conjuntos de vértices, entonces cada vértice del primer conjunto estará conectado cada vértice del segundo conjunto. continuación utilizamos is_chordal() para evaluar si nuestro grafo es cordal y buscar qué aristas faltan para rellenar el grafo: Luego, en una sola línea podemos añadir las aristas necesarias para que el grafo inicial sea cordal:","code":"g <- add_vertices(g, 3) g <- add_edges(g, edges = c(1,35, 1,36, 34,37)) g <- g + edges(c(1,35, 1,36, 34,37)) g <- add_edges(g, edges = c(38, 37)) ## Error in add_edges(g, edges = c(38, 37)): At vendor/cigraph/src/graph/type_indexededgelist.c:261 : Out-of-range vertex IDs when adding edges.

El propio grafo también puede tener estos atributos (por ejemplo, un nombre, que se mostrará en summary). En cierto sentido, cada grafo, vértice y arista puede ser utilizado como un espacio de nombres en R para almacenar y recuperar estos atributos. Para demostrar el uso de los atributos, creemos una red social sencilla: Cada vértice representa una persona, por lo que queremos almacenar sus edades, géneros y el tipo de conexión entre dos personas (is_formal() se refiere si una conexión entre una persona y otra es formal o informal, es decir, colegas o amigos). El operador $ es un atajo para obtener y establecer atributos de un grafo. Es más corto y tan legible como graph_attr() y set_graph_attr(). V y E son la forma estándar de obtener una secuencia de todos los vértices y aristas respectivamente. Esto asigna un atributo todos los vértices/aristas la vez. Otra forma de generar nuestra red social es con el uso de set_vertex_attr() y set_edge_attr() y el operador %>%: Para asignar o modificar un atributo un único vértice/arista: Los valores de los atributos pueden establecerse en cualquier objeto de R, pero ten en cuenta que almacenar el grafo en algunos formatos puede provocar la pérdida de valores en atributos complejos. Los vértices, las aristas y el propio grafo pueden utilizarse para establecer atributos, por ejemplo, para añadir una fecha al grafo: Para recuperar atributos, también puedes utilizar graph_attr(), vertex_attr() y edge_attr(). Para encontrar el ID de un vértice puedes utilizar la función match(): Para asignar atributos un subconjunto de vértices o aristas, puedes utilizar: Para eliminar atributos: Si quieres guardar un grafo en R con todos los atributos utiliza la función saveRDS() (y readRDS() para recuperarlo más tarde).","code":"g <- make_graph(   ~ Alice-Boris:Himari:Moshe,   Himari-Alice:Nang:Moshe:Samira,   Ibrahim-Nang:Moshe,    Nang-Samira ) V(g)$age <- c(25, 31, 18, 23, 47, 22, 50)  V(g)$gender <- c(\"f\", \"m\", \"f\", \"m\", \"m\", \"f\", \"m\") E(g)$is_formal <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) summary(g) ## IGRAPH 562e28d UN-- 7 9 --  ## + attr: name (v/c), age (v/n), gender (v/c), is_formal (e/l) g <- make_graph(   ~ Alice-Boris:Himari:Moshe,    Himari-Alice:Nang:Moshe:Samira,   Ibrahim-Nang:Moshe,    Nang-Samira ) %>%   set_vertex_attr(\"age\", value = c(25, 31, 18, 23, 47, 22, 50)) %>%   set_vertex_attr(\"gender\", value = c(\"f\", \"m\", \"f\", \"m\", \"m\", \"f\", \"m\")) %>%   set_edge_attr(\"is_formal\", value = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)) summary(g) E(g)$is_formal ## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE E(g)$is_formal[1] <- TRUE E(g)$is_formal ## [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE g$date <- c(\"2022-02-11\") graph_attr(g, \"date\") ## [1] \"2022-02-11\" match(c(\"Ibrahim\"), V(g)$name) ## [1] 7 V(g)$name[1:3] <- c(\"Alejandra\", \"Bruno\", \"Carmina\") V(g) ## + 7/7 vertices, named, from 562e28d: ## [1] Alejandra Bruno     Carmina   Moshe     Nang      Samira    Ibrahim g <- delete_vertex_attr(g, \"gender\") V(g)$gender ## NULL"},{"path":"https://r.igraph.org/articles/igraph_ES.html","id":"propiedades-estructurales-de-los-grafos","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Propiedades estructurales de los grafos","title":"igraph (interfaz R)","text":"igraph proporciona un amplio conjunto de métodos para calcular varias propiedades estructurales de los grafos. Está más allá del alcance de este tutorial documentar todos ellos, por lo que esta sección sólo presentará algunos de ellos con fines ilustrativos. Trabajaremos con la pequeña red social que construimos en la sección anterior. Probablemente, la propiedad más sencilla en la que se puede pensar es el “grado del vértice”. El grado de un vértice es igual al número de aristas incidentes él. En el caso de los grafos dirigidos, también podemos definir el grado de entrada (el número de aristas que apuntan hacia el vértice) y el grado de salida (el número de aristas que se originan en el vértice). igraph es capaz de calcularlos todos utilizando una sintaxis sencilla: Si el grafo fuera dirigido, podríamos calcular los grados de entrada y salida por separado utilizando degree(mode = \"\") y degree(mode = \"\"). También puedes pasar un único ID de un vértice o una lista de IDs de los vértices degree() si quieres calcular los grados sólo para un subconjunto de vértices: La mayoría de las funciones que aceptan los IDs de los vértices también aceptan los “nombres” de los vértices (es decir, los valores del atributo name del vértice) siempre que los nombres sean únicos: También funciona para vértices individuales: De igual manera, se utiliza una sintaxis similar para la mayoría de las propiedades estructurales que igraph puede calcular. Para las propiedades de los vértices, las funciones aceptan un ID, un nombre o una lista de IDs o nombres (y si se omiten, el valor predeterminado es el conjunto de todos los vértices). Para las propiedades de aristas, las funciones aceptan un único ID o una lista de IDs. NOTA: Para algunas mediciones, tiene sentido calcularlas sólo para unos pocos vértices o aristas en lugar de para todo el grafo, ya que de todas formas llevaría el mismo tiempo. En este caso, las funciones aceptan IDs de vértices o aristas, pero se puede restringir la lista resultante utilizando operaciones estándar. Un ejemplo es la centralidad de vectores propios (evcent()). Además del grado, igraph incluye funciones integradas para calcular muchas otras propiedades de centralidad, como la intermediación de vértices y aristas (edge_betweenness()) o el PageRank de Google (page_rank()), por nombrar algunas. Aquí sólo ilustraremos la intermediación de aristas: De este modo, ahora también podemos averiguar qué conexiones tienen la mayor centralidad de intermediación:","code":"degree(g) ## Alejandra     Bruno   Carmina     Moshe      Nang    Samira   Ibrahim  ##         3         1         4         3         3         2         2 degree(g, 7) ## Ibrahim  ##       2 degree(g, v = c(3,4,5)) ## Carmina   Moshe    Nang  ##       4       3       3 degree(g, v = c(\"Carmina\", \"Moshe\", \"Nang\")) ## Carmina   Moshe    Nang  ##       4       3       3 degree(g, \"Bruno\") ## Bruno  ##     1 edge_betweenness(g) ## [1] 6 6 4 3 4 4 4 2 3 ebs <- edge_betweenness(g) as_edgelist(g)[ebs == max(ebs), ] ##      [,1]        [,2]      ## [1,] \"Alejandra\" \"Bruno\"   ## [2,] \"Alejandra\" \"Carmina\""},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://r.igraph.org/articles/igraph_ES.html","id":"selección-de-vértices","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Búsqueda de vértices y aristas basada en atributos","what":"Selección de vértices","title":"igraph (interfaz R)","text":"Tomando como ejemplo la red social anteriormente creada, te gustaría averiguar quién tiene el mayor grado. Puedes hacerlo con las herramientas presentadas hasta ahora y con la función .max(): Otro ejemplo sería seleccionar sólo los vértices que tienen IDs impares, utilizando la función V(): Por supuesto, es posible seleccionar vértices o aristas mediante índices posicionales: Al seleccionar un vértice que existe se produce un error: Los nombres de los atributos también pueden utilizarse tal cual dentro de los operadores de indexación (“[]”) de V() y E(). Esto puede combinarse con la capacidad de R de utilizar vectores booleanos para indexar y obtener expresiones muy concisas y legibles para recuperar un subconjunto del set de vértices o aristas de un grafo. Por ejemplo, el siguiente comando nos da los nombres de los individuos menores de 30 años de nuestra red social: Por supuesto, < es el único operador booleano que puede utilizarse para esto. Otras posibilidades son las siguientes: También puede crear un operador “incluido en” partir de %% utilizando el operador Negate: Si un atributo tiene el mismo nombre que una función de igraph, debes tener cuidado ya que la sintaxis puede llegar ser un poco confusa.

Como ya se ha mencionado, la forma estándar de obtener aristas es E. Además, existen algunas propiedades estructurales especiales para seleccionar aristas. El uso de .() permite filtrar la serie de aristas desde los vértices de donde proceden. Por ejemplo, para seleccionar todas las aristas procedentes de Carmina (cuyo ID de vértice es el 3): Por supuesto, también funciona con nombres de vértices: Al usar .(), se filtran la serie de aristas en función de los vértices de destino o diana. Esto es diferente de .() si el grafo es dirigido, mientras que da la misma respuesta para grafos dirigidos. Con .inc() sólo se seleccionan las aristas que inciden en un único vértice o en al menos uno de los vértices, independientemente de la dirección de las aristas. La expresión %--% es un operador especial que puede utilizarse para seleccionar todas las aristas entre dos conjuntos de vértices. Ignora las direcciones de las aristas en los grafos dirigidos. Por ejemplo, la siguiente expresión selecciona todas las aristas entre Carmina (su ID de vértice es el 3), Nang (su ID de vértice es el 5) y Samira (su ID de vértice es el 6): Para que el operador %--% funcione con nombres, puedes construir vectores de caracteres que contengan los nombres y luego utilizar estos vectores como operandos.

El argumento layout también acepta funciones; en este caso, la función será llamada con el grafo como su primer argumento. Esto permite ingresar directamente el nombre de una función de diseño, sin tener que crear una variable de diseño, como en el ejemplo anterior:  Para mejorar el aspecto visual, una adición trivial sería colorear los vértices según el género. También deberíamos intentar colocar los nombres ligeramente fuera de los vértices para mejorar la legibilidad:  También puedes tratar el atributo gender como un factor y proporcionar los colores como un argumento plot(), que tiene prioridad sobre el atributo color que se asigna de manera estándar los vértices. Los colores se asignan automáticamente:  Como se vio anteriormente, con el argumento vertex.color puedes especificar propiedades visuales para plot en lugar de usar y/o manipular los atributos de vértices o aristas.
