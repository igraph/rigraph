# `stimulus`

This repository hosts an experimental code generator for high-level interfaces
of igraph.

`stimulus` has already been used to generate a significant part of the codebase
of the R interface of igraph. The aim of this repository is to refactor it in a
way that makes it easier to potentially use `stimulus` for other high-level
interfaces (e.g., the Python interface, which still relies on hand-written code
for the Python bindings).
