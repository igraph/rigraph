#' Diameter of a graph
#'
#' The diameter of a graph is the length of the longest geodesic.
#'
#' The diameter is calculated by using a breadth-first search like method.
#'
#' `get_diameter()` returns a path with the actual diameter. If there are
#' many shortest paths of the length of the diameter, then it returns the first
#' one found.
#'
#' `farthest_vertices()` returns two vertex ids, the vertices which are
#' connected by the diameter path.
#'
#' @param graph The graph to analyze.
#' @param directed Logical, whether directed or undirected paths are to be
#'   considered. This is ignored for undirected graphs.
#' @param unconnected Logical, what to do if the graph is unconnected. If
#'   FALSE, the function will return a number that is one larger the largest
#'   possible diameter, which is always the number of vertices. If TRUE, the
#'   diameters of the connected components will be calculated and the largest one
#'   will be returned.
#' @param weights Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
#'   distances. If the graph has a `weight` edge attribute, then this is
#'   used by default.
#' @return A numeric constant for `diameter()`, a numeric vector for
#'   `get_diameter()`. `farthest_vertices()` returns a list with two
#'   entries: \itemize{
#'   \item `vertices` The two vertices that are the farthest.
#'   \item `distance` Their distance.

#' Shortest (directed or undirected) paths between vertices
#'
#' `distances()` calculates the length of all the shortest paths from
#' or to the vertices in the network. `shortest_paths()` calculates one
#' shortest path (the path itself, and not just its length) from or to the
#' given vertex.
#'
#' The shortest path, or geodesic between two pair of vertices is a path with
#' the minimal number of vertices. The functions documented in this manual page
#' all calculate shortest paths between vertex pairs.
#'
#' `distances()` calculates the lengths of pairwise shortest paths from
#' a set of vertices (`from`) to another set of vertices (`to`). It
#' uses different algorithms, depending on the `algorithm` argument and
#' the `weight` edge attribute of the graph. The implemented algorithms
#' are breadth-first search (\sQuote{`unweighted`}), this only works for
#' unweighted graphs; the Dijkstra algorithm (\sQuote{`dijkstra`}), this
#' works for graphs with non-negative edge weights; the Bellman-Ford algorithm
#' (\sQuote{`bellman-ford`}); Johnson's algorithm
#' (\sQuote{`johnson`}); and a faster version of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm
#' with expected quadratic running time (\sQuote{`floyd-warshall`}). The latter
#' three algorithms work with arbitrary
#' edge weights, but (naturally) only for graphs that don't have a negative
#' cycle. Note that a negative-weight edge in an undirected graph implies
#' such a cycle. Johnson's algorithm performs better than the Bellman-Ford
#' one when many source (and target) vertices are given, with all-pairs
#' shortest path length calculations being the typical use case.
#'
#' igraph can choose automatically between algorithms, and chooses the most
#' efficient one that is appropriate for the supplied weights (if any). For
#' automatic algorithm selection, supply \sQuote{`automatic`} as the
#' `algorithm` argument. (This is also the default.)
#'
#' `shortest_paths()` calculates a single shortest path (i.e. the path
#' itself, not just its length) between the source vertex given in `from`,
#' to the target vertices given in `to`. `shortest_paths()` uses
#' breadth-first search for unweighted graphs and Dijkstra's algorithm for
#' weighted graphs. The latter only works if the edge weights are non-negative.
#'
#' `all_shortest_paths()` calculates *all* shortest paths between
#' pairs of vertices, including several shortest paths of the same length.
#' More precisely, it computerd all shortest path starting at `from`, and
#' ending at any vertex given in `to`. It uses a breadth-first search for
#' unweighted graphs and Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted ones. The latter
#' only supports non-negative edge weights. Caution: in multigraphs, the
#' result size is exponentially large in the number of vertex pairs with
#' multiple edges between them.
#'
#' `mean_distance()` calculates the average path length in a graph, by
#' calculating the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices (both ways for
#' directed graphs). It uses a breadth-first search for unweighted graphs and
#' Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted ones. The latter only supports non-negative
#' edge weights.
#'
#' `distance_table()` calculates a histogram, by calculating the shortest
#' path length between each pair of vertices. For directed graphs both
#' directions are considered, so every pair of vertices appears twice in the
#' histogram.
#'
#' @param graph The graph to work on.
#' @param v Numeric vector, the vertices from which the shortest paths will be
#'   calculated.
#' @param to Numeric vector, the vertices to which the shortest paths will be
#'   calculated. By default it includes all vertices. Note that for
#'   `distances()` every vertex must be included here at most once. (This
#'   is not required for `shortest_paths()`.
#' @param mode Character constant, gives whether the shortest paths to or from
#'   the given vertices should be calculated for directed graphs. If `out`
#'   then the shortest paths *from* the vertex, if `in` then *to*
#'   it will be considered. If `all`, the default, then the graph is treated
#'   as undirected, i.e. edge directions are not taken into account. This
#'   argument is ignored for undirected graphs.
#' @param weights Possibly a numeric vector giving edge weights. If this is
#'   `NULL` and the graph has a `weight` edge attribute, then the
#'   attribute is used. If this is `NA` then no weights are used (even if
#'   the graph has a `weight` attribute). In a weighted graph, the length
#'   of a path is the sum of the weights of its constituent edges.
#' @param algorithm Which algorithm to use for the calculation. By default
#'   igraph tries to select the fastest suitable algorithm. If there are no
#'   weights, then an unweighted breadth-first search is used, otherwise if all
#'   weights are positive, then Dijkstra's algorithm is used. If there are
#'   negative weights and we do the calculation for more than 100 sources, then
#'   Johnson's algorithm is used. Otherwise the Bellman-Ford algorithm is used.
#'   You can override igraph's choice by explicitly giving this parameter. Note
#'   that the igraph C core might still override your choice in obvious cases,
#'   i.e. if there are no edge weights, then the unweighted algorithm will be
#'   used, regardless of this argument.
#' @param details Whether to provide additional details in the result.
#'   Functions accepting this argument (like `mean_distance()`) return
#'   additional information like the number of disconnected vertex pairs in
#'   the result when this parameter is set to `TRUE`.
#' @param unconnected What to do if the graph is unconnected (not
#'   strongly connected if directed paths are considered). If TRUE, only
#'   the lengths of the existing paths are considered and averaged; if
#'   FALSE, the length of the missing paths are considered as having infinite
#'   length, making the mean distance infinite as well.
#' @return For `distances()` a numeric matrix with `length(to)`
#'   columns and `length(v)` rows. The shortest path length from a vertex to
#'   itself is always zero. For unreachable vertices `Inf` is included.
#'
#'   For `shortest_paths()` a named list with four entries is returned:
#'   \item{vpath}{This itself is a list, of length `length(to)`; list
#'   element `i` contains the vertex ids on the path from vertex `from`
#'   to vertex `to[i]` (or the other way for directed graphs depending on
#'   the `mode` argument). The vector also contains `from` and `i`
#'   as the first and last elements. If `from` is the same as `i` then
#'   it is only included once. If there is no path between two vertices then a
#'   numeric vector of length zero is returned as the list element. If this
#'   output is not requested in the `output` argument, then it will be
#'   `NULL`.} \item{epath}{This is a list similar to `vpath`, but the
#'   vectors of the list contain the edge ids along the shortest paths, instead
#'   of the vertex ids. This entry is set to `NULL` if it is not requested
#'   in the `output` argument.} \item{predecessors}{Numeric vector, the
#'   predecessor of each vertex in the `to` argument, or `NULL` if it
#'   was not requested.} \item{inbound_edges}{Numeric vector, the inbound edge
#'   for each vertex, or `NULL`, if it was not requested.}
#'
#'   For `all_shortest_paths()` a list is returned, each list element
#'   contains a shortest path from `from` to a vertex in `to`. The
#'   shortest paths to the same vertex are collected into consecutive elements
#'   of the list.
#'
#'   For `mean_distance()` a single number is returned if `details=FALSE`,
#'   or a named list with two entries: `res` is the mean distance as a numeric
#'   scalar and `unconnected` is the number of unconnected vertex pairs,
#'   also as a numeric scalar.
#'
#'   `distance_table()` returns a named list with two entries: `res` is
#'   a numeric vector, the histogram of distances, `unconnected` is a
#'   numeric scalar, the number of pairs for which the first vertex is not
#'   reachable from the second. In undirected and directed graphs, unorderde
#'   and ordered pairs are considered, respectively. Therefore the sum of the
#'   two entries is always \eqn{n(n-1)} for directed graphs and \eqn{n(n-1)/2}
#'   for undirected graphs.

#' Subgraph of a graph
#'
#' `subgraph()` creates a subgraph of a graph, containing only the specified

#' `induced_subgraph()` calculates the induced subgraph of a set of vertices
#' in a graph. This means that exactly the specified vertices and all the edges

#'
#' The `subgraph()` function currently does the same as `induced_subgraph()`

#' Transitivity of a graph

#' Transitivity measures the probability that the adjacent vertices of a vertex
#' are connected. This is sometimes also called the clustering coefficient.
#'
#' Note that there are essentially two classes of transitivity measures, one is
#' a vertex-level, the other a graph level property.
#'
#' There are several generalizations of transitivity to weighted graphs, here
#' we use the definition by A. Barrat, this is a local vertex-level quantity,
#' its formula is
#'
#' \deqn{C_i^w=\frac{1}{s_i(k_i-1)}\sum_{j,h}\frac{w_{ij}+w_{ih}}{2}a_{ij}a_{ih}a_{jh}}{
#' weighted C_i = 1/s_i 1/(k_i-1) sum( (w_ij+w_ih)/2 a_ij a_ih a_jh, j, h)}
#'
#' \eqn{s_i}{s_i} is the strength of vertex \eqn{i}{i}, see
#' [strength()], \eqn{a_{ij}}{a_ij} are elements of the
#' adjacency matrix, \eqn{k_i}{k_i} is the vertex degree, \eqn{w_{ij}}{w_ij}
#' are the weights.
#'
#' This formula gives back the normal not-weighted local transitivity if all
#' the edge weights are the same.
#'
#' The `barrat` type of transitivity does not work for graphs with
#' multiple and/or loop edges. If you want to calculate it for a directed
#' graph, call [as.undirected()] with the `collapse` mode first.
#'
#' @param graph The graph to analyze.
#' @param type The type of the transitivity to calculate. Possible values:
#'   \describe{ \item{"global"}{The global transitivity of an undirected
#'   graph. This is simply the ratio of the count of triangles and connected triples
#'   in the graph. In directed graphs, edge directions are ignored.}
#'   \item{"local"}{The local transitivity of an undirected graph. It is
#'   calculated for each vertex given in the `vids` argument. The local
#'   transitivity of a vertex is the ratio of the count of triangles connected to the
#'   vertex and the triples centered on the vertex. In directed graphs, edge
#'   directions are ignored.}
#'   \item{"undirected"}{This is the same as `global`.}
#'   \item{"globalundirected"}{This is the same as `global`.}
#'   \item{"localundirected"}{This is the same as `local`.}
#'   \item{"barrat"}{The weighted transitivity as defined by A.
#'   Barrat. See details below.}
#'   \item{"weighted"}{The same as `barrat`.} }
#' @param vids The vertex ids for the local transitivity will be calculated.
#'   This will be ignored for global transitivity types.  The default value is
#'   `NULL`, in this case all vertices are considered. It is slightly faster
#'   to supply `NULL` here than `V(graph)`.
#' @param weights Optional weights for weighted transitivity. It is ignored for
#'   other transitivity measures. If it is `NULL` (the default) and the
#'   graph has a `weight` edge attribute, then it is used automatically.
#' @param isolates Character scalar, for local versions of transitivity, it
#'   defines how to treat vertices with degree zero and one.
#'   If it is \sQuote{`NaN`} then their local transitivity is
#'   reported as `NaN` and they are not included in the averaging, for the
#'   transitivity types that calculate an average. If there are no vertices with
#'   degree two or higher, then the averaging will still result `NaN`. If it
#'   is \sQuote{`zero`}, then we report 0 transitivity for them, and they
#'   are included in the averaging, if an average is calculated.
#'   For the global transitivity, it controls how to handle graphs with
#'   no connected triplets: `NaN` or zero will be returned according to
#'   the respective setting.
#' @return For \sQuote{`global`} a single number, or `NaN` if there
#'   are no connected triples in the graph.
#'
#'   For \sQuote{`local`} a vector of transitivity scores, one for each
#'   vertex in \sQuote{`vids`}.

#' Burt's constraint
#'
#' Given a graph, `constraint()` calculates Burt's constraint for each

#'
#' Burt's constraint is higher if ego has less, or mutually
#' stronger related (i.e. more redundant) contacts. Burt's measure of
#' constraint, \eqn{C_i}{C[i]}, of vertex \eqn{i}'s ego network
#' \eqn{V_i}{V[i]}, is defined for directed and valued graphs,
#' \deqn{C_i=\sum_{j \in V_i \setminus \{i\}} (p_{ij}+\sum_{q \in V_i
#'     \setminus \{i,j\}} p_{iq} p_{qj})^2}{

#' }
#' for a graph of order (i.e. number of vertices) \eqn{N}, where

#' Reciprocity of graphs
#'
#' Calculates the reciprocity of a directed graph.
#'
#' The measure of reciprocity defines the proportion of mutual connections, in
#' a directed graph. It is most commonly defined as the probability that the
#' opposite counterpart of a directed edge is also included in the graph. Or in
#' adjacency matrix notation:
#' \eqn{1 - \left(\sum_{i,j} |A_{ij} - A_{ji}|\right) / \left(2\sum_{i,j} A_{ij}\right)}{1 - (sum_ij |A_ij - A_ji|) / (2 sum_ij A_ij)}.
#' This measure is calculated if the `mode` argument is `default`.
#'
#' Prior to igraph version 0.6, another measure was implemented, defined as the
#' probability of mutual connection between a vertex pair, if we know that
#' there is a (possibly non-mutual) connection between them. In other words,
#' (unordered) vertex pairs are classified into three groups: (1)
#' not-connected, (2) non-reciprocally connected, (3) reciprocally connected.
#' The result is the size of group (3), divided by the sum of group sizes
#' (2)+(3). This measure is calculated if `mode` is `ratio`.
#'
#' @param graph The graph object.
#' @param ignore.loops Logical constant, whether to ignore loop edges.
#' @param mode See below.
#' @return A numeric scalar between zero and one.

#' Graph density
#'
#' The density of a graph is the ratio of the actual number of edges and the
#' largest possible number of edges in the graph, assuming that no multi-edges
#' are present.
#'
#' The concept of density is ill-defined for multigraphs. Note that this function
#' does not check whether the graph has multi-edges and will return meaningless
#' results for such graphs.
#'
#' @param graph The input graph.
#' @param loops Logical constant, whether loop edges may exist in the graph.
#'   This affects the calculation of the largest possible number of edges in the
#'   graph. If this parameter is set to FALSE yet the graph contains self-loops,
#'   the result will not be meaningful.
#' @return A real constant. This function returns `NaN` (=0.0/0.0) for an
#'   empty graph with zero vertices.

#' Topological sorting of vertices in a graph

#' Girth of a graph

#' This implementation is based on Alon Itai and Michael Rodeh: Finding a

#' Find the multiple or loop edges in a graph
#'
#' A loop edge is an edge from a vertex to itself. An edge is a multiple edge
#' if it has exactly the same head and tail vertices as another edge. A graph
#' without multiple and loop edges is called a simple graph.
#'
#' `any_loop()` decides whether the graph has any loop edges.
#'
#' `which_loop()` decides whether the edges of the graph are loop edges.
#'
#' `any_multiple()` decides whether the graph has any multiple edges.
#'
#' `which_multiple()` decides whether the edges of the graph are multiple
#' edges.
#'
#' `count_multiple()` counts the multiplicity of each edge of a graph.
#'
#' Note that the semantics for `which_multiple()` and `count_multiple()` is
#' different. `which_multiple()` gives `TRUE` for all occurrences of a
#' multiple edge except for one. I.e. if there are three `i-j` edges in the
#' graph then `which_multiple()` returns `TRUE` for only two of them while
#' `count_multiple()` returns \sQuote{3} for all three.
#'
#' See the examples for getting rid of multiple edges while keeping their
#' original multiplicity as an edge attribute.
#'
#' @param graph The input graph.
#' @param eids The edges to which the query is restricted. By default this is
#'   all edges in the graph.
#' @return `any_loop()` and `any_multiple()` return a logical scalar.
#'   `which_loop()` and `which_multiple()` return a logical vector.
#'   `count_multiple()` returns a numeric vector.

#' Breadth-first search
#'
#' Breadth-first search is an algorithm to traverse a graph. We start from a
#' root vertex and spread along every edge \dQuote{simultaneously}.
#'
#'
#' The callback function must have the following arguments:
#' \describe{
#' \item{graph}{The input graph is passed to the callback function here.}
#' \item{data}{A named numeric vector, with the following entries:
#' \sQuote{vid}, the vertex that was just visited, \sQuote{pred}, its

#' current vertex, \sQuote{dist}, its distance from the root of the search
#' tree.}
#' \item{extra}{The extra argument.}
#' }
#'
#' The callback must return `FALSE`
#' to continue the search or `TRUE` to terminate it. See examples below on how to
#' use the callback function.
#'
#' @param graph The input graph.
#' @param root Numeric vector, usually of length one. The root vertex, or root
#'   vertices to start the search from.
#' @param mode For directed graphs specifies the type of edges to follow.
#'   \sQuote{out} follows outgoing, \sQuote{in} incoming edges. \sQuote{all}
#'   ignores edge directions completely. \sQuote{total} is a synonym for
#'   \sQuote{all}. This argument is ignored for undirected graphs.
#' @param unreachable Logical scalar, whether the search should visit the
#'   vertices that are unreachable from the given root vertex (or vertices). If
#'   `TRUE`, then additional searches are performed until all vertices are
#'   visited.
#' @param restricted `NULL` (=no restriction), or a vector of vertices
#'   (ids or symbolic names). In the latter case, the search is restricted to the
#'   given vertices.
#' @param order Logical scalar, whether to return the ordering of the vertices.
#' @param rank Logical scalar, whether to return the rank of the vertices.
#' @param father Logical scalar, whether to return the father of the vertices.

#'   vertices.
#' @param dist Logical scalar, whether to return the distance from the root of

#' @param callback If not `NULL`, then it must be callback function. This
#'   is called whenever a vertex is visited. See details below.
#' @param extra Additional argument to supply to the callback function.
#' @param rho The environment in which the callback function is evaluated.

#' Graph Laplacian
#'
#' The Laplacian of a graph.
#'
#' The Laplacian Matrix of a graph is a symmetric matrix having the same number
#' of rows and columns as the number of vertices in the graph and element (i,j)
#' is d\[i\], the degree of vertex i if if i==j, -1 if i!=j and there is an edge
#' between vertices i and j and 0 otherwise.
#'
#' A normalized version of the Laplacian Matrix is similar: element (i,j) is 1
#' if i==j, -1/sqrt(d\[i\] d\[j\]) if i!=j and there is an edge between vertices i
#' and j and 0 otherwise.
#'
#' The weighted version of the Laplacian simply works with the weighted degree
#' instead of the plain degree. I.e. (i,j) is d\[i\], the weighted degree of
#' vertex i if if i==j, -w if i!=j and there is an edge between vertices i and
#' j with weight w, and 0 otherwise. The weighted degree of a vertex is the sum
#' of the weights of its adjacent edges.
#'
#' @param graph The input graph.
#' @param normalized Whether to calculate the normalized Laplacian. See
#'   definitions below.
#' @param weights An optional vector giving edge weights for weighted Laplacian
#'   matrix. If this is `NULL` and the graph has an edge attribute called
#'   `weight`, then it will be used automatically. Set this to `NA` if
#'   you want the unweighted Laplacian on a graph that has a `weight` edge
#'   attribute.
#' @param sparse Logical scalar, whether to return the result as a sparse
#'   matrix. The `Matrix` package is required for sparse matrices.
#' @return A numeric matrix.

#' Matching
#'
#' A matching in a graph means the selection of a set of edges that are
#' pairwise non-adjacent, i.e. they have no common incident vertices. A
#' matching is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other matching.
#'
#' `is_matching()` checks a matching vector and verifies whether its
#' length matches the number of vertices in the given graph, its values are
#' between zero (inclusive) and the number of vertices (inclusive), and
#' whether there exists a corresponding edge in the graph for every matched
#' vertex pair. For bipartite graphs, it also verifies whether the matched
#' vertices are in different parts of the graph.
#'
#' `is_max_matching()` checks whether a matching is maximal.  A matching
#' is maximal if and only if there exists no unmatched vertex in a graph
#' such that one of its neighbors is also unmatched.
#'
#' `max_bipartite_match()` calculates a maximum matching in a bipartite
#' graph. A matching in a bipartite graph is a partial assignment of
#' vertices of the first kind to vertices of the second kind such that each
#' vertex of the first kind is matched to at most one vertex of the second
#' kind and vice versa, and matched vertices must be connected by an edge
#' in the graph. The size (or cardinality) of a matching is the number of
#' edges. A matching is a maximum matching if there exists no other
#' matching with larger cardinality.  For weighted graphs, a maximum
#' matching is a matching whose edges have the largest possible total
#' weight among all possible matchings.
#'
#' Maximum matchings in bipartite graphs are found by the push-relabel
#' algorithm with greedy initialization and a global relabeling after every
#' \eqn{n/2} steps where \eqn{n} is the number of vertices in the graph.
#'
#' @rdname matching
#' @aliases max_bipartite_match
#' @param graph The input graph. It might be directed, but edge directions will
#'   be ignored.
#' @param types Vertex types, if the graph is bipartite. By default they
#'   are taken from the \sQuote{`type`} vertex attribute, if present.
#' @param matching A potential matching. An integer vector that gives the
#'   pair in the matching for each vertex. For vertices without a pair,
#'   supply `NA` here.
#' @param weights Potential edge weights. If the graph has an edge
#'   attribute called \sQuote{`weight`}, and this argument is
#'   `NULL`, then the edge attribute is used automatically.
#'   In weighted matching, the weights of the edges must match as
#'   much as possible.
#' @param eps A small real number used in equality tests in the weighted
#'   bipartite matching algorithm. Two real numbers are considered equal in
#'   the algorithm if their difference is smaller than `eps`. This is
#'   required to avoid the accumulation of numerical errors. By default it is
#'   set to the smallest \eqn{x}, such that \eqn{1+x \ne 1}{1+x != 1}
#'   holds. If you are running the algorithm with no weights, this argument
#'   is ignored.
#' @return `is_matching()` and `is_max_matching()` return a logical
#'   scalar.
#'
#'   `max_bipartite_match()` returns a list with components:
#'   \item{matching_size}{The size of the matching, i.e. the number of edges
#'     connecting the matched vertices.}
#'   \item{matching_weight}{The weights of the matching, if the graph was
#'     weighted. For unweighted graphs this is the same as the size of the
#'     matching.}
#'   \item{matching}{The matching itself. Numeric vertex id, or vertex
#'     names if the graph was named. Non-matched vertices are denoted by
#'     `NA`.}

#' Find mutual edges in a directed graph
#'
#' This function checks the reciprocal pair of the supplied edges.
#'
#' In a directed graph an (A,B) edge is mutual if the graph also includes a
#' (B,A) directed edge.
#'
#' Note that multi-graphs are not handled properly, i.e. if the graph contains
#' two copies of (A,B) and one copy of (B,A), then these three edges are
#' considered to be mutual.
#'
#' Undirected graphs contain only mutual edges by definition.
#'
#' @param graph The input graph.
#' @param eids Edge sequence, the edges that will be probed. By default is
#'   includes all edges in the order of their ids.
#' @param loops Logical, whether to consider directed self-loops to be mutual.
#' @return A logical vector of the same length as the number of edges supplied.

#' Average nearest neighbor degree
#'
#' Calculate the average nearest neighbor degree of the given vertices and the
#' same quantity in the function of vertex degree
#'
#' Note that for zero degree vertices the answer in \sQuote{`knn`} is
#' `NaN` (zero divided by zero), the same is true for \sQuote{`knnk`}
#' if a given degree never appears in the network.
#'
#' The weighted version computes a weighted average of the neighbor degrees as
#'
#' \deqn{k_{nn,u} = \frac{1}{s_u} \sum_v w_{uv} k_v,}{k_nn_u = 1/s_u sum_v w_uv k_v,}
#'
#' where \eqn{s_u = \sum_v w_{uv}}{s_u = sum_v w_uv} is the sum of the incident
#' edge weights of vertex `u`, i.e. its strength.
#' The sum runs over the neighbors `v` of vertex `u`
#' as indicated by `mode`. \eqn{w_{uv}}{w_uv} denotes the weighted adjacency matrix
#' and \eqn{k_v}{k_v} is the neighbors' degree, specified by `neighbor_degree_mode`.
#'
#' @param graph The input graph. It may be directed.
#' @param vids The vertices for which the calculation is performed. Normally it
#'   includes all vertices. Note, that if not all vertices are given here, then
#'   both \sQuote{`knn`} and \sQuote{`knnk`} will be calculated based
#'   on the given vertices only.
#' @param mode Character constant to indicate the type of neighbors to consider
#'   in directed graphs. `out` considers out-neighbors, `in` considers
#'   in-neighbors and `all` ignores edge directions.
#' @param neighbor.degree.mode The type of degree to average in directed graphs.
#'   `out` averages out-degrees, `in` averages in-degrees and `all`
#'   ignores edge directions for the degree calculation.
#' @param weights Weight vector. If the graph has a `weight` edge
#'   attribute, then this is used by default. If this argument is given, then
#'   vertex strength (see [strength()]) is used instead of vertex
#'   degree. But note that `knnk` is still given in the function of the
#'   normal vertex degree.
#'   Weights are are used to calculate a weighted degree (also called
#'   [strength()]) instead of the degree.
#' @return A list with two members: \item{knn}{A numeric vector giving the
#'   average nearest neighbor degree for all vertices in `vids`.}
#'   \item{knnk}{A numeric vector, its length is the maximum (total) vertex
#'   degree in the graph. The first element is the average nearest neighbor
#'   degree of vertices with degree one, etc.  }
