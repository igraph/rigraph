#' Vertex and edge betweenness centrality
#'
#' The vertex and edge betweenness are (roughly) defined by the number of
#' geodesics (shortest paths) going through a vertex or an edge.
#'
#' The vertex betweenness of vertex `v` is defined by
#'
#' \deqn{\sum_{i\ne j, i\ne v, j\ne v} g_{ivj}/g_{ij}}{sum( g_ivj / g_ij,
#' i!=j,i!=v,j!=v)}
#'
#' The edge betweenness of edge `e` is defined by
#'
#' \deqn{\sum_{i\ne j} g_{iej}/g_{ij}.}{sum( g_iej / g_ij, i!=j).}
#'
#' `betweenness()` calculates vertex betweenness, `edge_betweenness()`
#' calculates edge betweenness.
#'
#' Here \eqn{g_{ij}}{g_ij} is the total number of shortest paths between vertices
#' \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} while \eqn{g_{ivj}} is the number of those shortest paths
#' which pass though vertex \eqn{v}.
#'
#' Both functions allow you to consider only paths of length `cutoff` or
#' smaller; this can be run for larger graphs, as the running time is not
#' quadratic (if `cutoff` is small). If `cutoff` is negative (the default),
#' then the function calculates the exact betweenness scores. Since igraph 1.6.0,
#' a `cutoff` value of zero is treated literally, i.e. paths of length larger
#' than zero are ignored.
#'
#' For calculating the betweenness a similar algorithm to the one proposed by
#' Brandes (see References) is used.
#'
#' @aliases betweenness.estimate
#' @aliases edge.betweenness.estimate
#' @param graph The graph to analyze.
#' @param v The vertices for which the vertex betweenness will be calculated.
#' @param directed Logical, whether directed paths should be considered while
#'   determining the shortest paths.
#' @param weights Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
#'   betweenness. If the graph has a `weight` edge attribute, then this is
#'   used by default. Weights are used to calculate weighted shortest paths,
#'   so they are interpreted as distances.
#' @param normalized Logical scalar, whether to normalize the betweenness
#'   scores. If `TRUE`, then the results are normalized by the number of ordered
#'   or unordered vertex pairs in directed and undirected graphs, respectively.
#'   In an undirected graph,
#'   \deqn{B^n=\frac{2B}{(n-1)(n-2)},}{Bnorm=2 B / ((n-1)(n-2)),}
#'   where
#'   \eqn{B^n}{Bnorm} is the normalized, \eqn{B} the raw betweenness, and
#'   \eqn{n} is the number of vertices in the graph. Note that the same
#'   normalization factor is used even when setting a `cutoff` on the considered
#'   shortest path lengths, even though the number of vertex pairs reachable
#'   from each other may be less than \eqn{(n-1)(n-2)/2}.
#' @param cutoff The maximum shortest path length to consider when calculating
#'   betweenness. If negative, then there is no such limit.
#' @return A numeric vector with the betweenness score for each vertex in
#'   `v` for `betweenness()`.
#'
#'   A numeric vector with the edge betweenness score for each edge in `e`
#'   for `edge_betweenness()`.
#'
#' @note `edge_betweenness()` might give false values for graphs with
#' multiple edges.

#' Closeness centrality of vertices
#'
#' Closeness centrality measures how many steps is required to access every other
#' vertex from a given vertex.
#'
#' The closeness centrality of a vertex is defined as the inverse of the
#' sum of distances to all the other vertices in the graph:
#'
#' \deqn{\frac{1}{\sum_{i\ne v} d_{vi}}}{1/sum( d(v,i), i != v)}
#'
#' If there is no (directed) path between vertex `v` and `i`, then
#' `i` is omitted from the calculation. If no other vertices are reachable
#' from `v`, then its closeness is returned as NaN.
#'
# " You may use the \code{cutoff} argument to consider only paths of length
#' `cutoff` or smaller. This can be run for larger graphs, as the running
#' time is not quadratic (if `cutoff` is small). If `cutoff` is
#' negative (which is the default), then the function calculates the exact
#' closeness scores. Since igraph 1.6.0, a `cutoff` value of zero is treated
#' literally, i.e. path with a length greater than zero are ignored.

#'   graphs.
#' @param normalized Logical scalar, whether to calculate the normalized

#' ARPACK eigenvector calculation
#'
#' Interface to the ARPACK library for calculating eigenvectors of sparse
#' matrices
#'
#' ARPACK is a library for solving large scale eigenvalue problems.  The
#' package is designed to compute a few eigenvalues and corresponding
#' eigenvectors of a general \eqn{n} by \eqn{n} matrix \eqn{A}. It is most
#' appropriate for large sparse or structured matrices \eqn{A} where structured
#' means that a matrix-vector product `w <- Av` requires order \eqn{n}
#' rather than the usual order \eqn{n^2} floating point operations.
#'
#' This function is an interface to ARPACK. igraph does not contain all ARPACK
#' routines, only the ones dealing with symmetric and non-symmetric eigenvalue
#' problems using double precision real numbers.
#'
#' The eigenvalue calculation in ARPACK (in the simplest case) involves the
#' calculation of the \eqn{Av} product where \eqn{A} is the matrix we work with
#' and \eqn{v} is an arbitrary vector. The function supplied in the `fun`
#' argument is expected to perform this product. If the product can be done
#' efficiently, e.g. if the matrix is sparse, then `arpack()` is usually
#' able to calculate the eigenvalues very quickly.
#'
#' The `options` argument specifies what kind of calculation to perform.
#' It is a list with the following members, they correspond directly to ARPACK
#' parameters. On input it has the following fields: \describe{
#' \item{bmat}{Character constant, possible values: \sQuote{`I`}, standard
#' eigenvalue problem, \eqn{Ax=\lambda x}{A*x=lambda*x}; and \sQuote{`G`},
#' generalized eigenvalue problem, \eqn{Ax=\lambda B x}{A*x=lambda B*x}.
#' Currently only \sQuote{`I`} is supported.} \item{n}{Numeric scalar. The
#' dimension of the eigenproblem. You only need to set this if you call
#' [arpack()] directly. (I.e. not needed for
#' [eigen_centrality()], [page_rank()], etc.)}
#' \item{which}{Specify which eigenvalues/vectors to compute, character
#' constant with exactly two characters.
#'
#' Possible values for symmetric input matrices: \describe{
#' \item{"LA"}{Compute `nev` largest (algebraic) eigenvalues.}
#' \item{"SA"}{Compute `nev` smallest (algebraic)
#' eigenvalues.} \item{"LM"}{Compute `nev` largest (in
#' magnitude) eigenvalues.} \item{"SM"}{Compute `nev` smallest
#' (in magnitude) eigenvalues.} \item{"BE"}{Compute `nev`
#' eigenvalues, half from each end of the spectrum. When `nev` is odd,
#' compute one more from the high end than from the low end.} }
#'
#' Possible values for non-symmetric input matrices: \describe{
#' \item{"LM"}{Compute `nev` eigenvalues of largest
#' magnitude.} \item{"SM"}{Compute `nev` eigenvalues of
#' smallest magnitude.} \item{"LR"}{Compute `nev` eigenvalues
#' of largest real part.} \item{"SR"}{Compute `nev`
#' eigenvalues of smallest real part.} \item{"LI"}{Compute
#' `nev` eigenvalues of largest imaginary part.}
#' \item{"SI"}{Compute `nev` eigenvalues of smallest imaginary
#' part.} }
#'
#' This parameter is sometimes overwritten by the various functions, e.g.
#' [page_rank()] always sets \sQuote{`LM`}.  }
#' \item{nev}{Numeric scalar. The number of eigenvalues to be computed.}
#' \item{tol}{Numeric scalar. Stopping criterion: the relative accuracy of the
#' Ritz value is considered acceptable if its error is less than `tol`
#' times its estimated value. If this is set to zero then machine precision is
#' used.} \item{ncv}{Number of Lanczos vectors to be generated.}
#' \item{ldv}{Numberic scalar. It should be set to zero in the current
#' implementation.} \item{ishift}{Either zero or one. If zero then the shifts
#' are provided by the user via reverse communication. If one then exact shifts
#' with respect to the reduced tridiagonal matrix \eqn{T}.  Please always set
#' this to one.} \item{maxiter}{Maximum number of Arnoldi update iterations
#' allowed. } \item{nb}{Blocksize to be used in the recurrence. Please always
#' leave this on the default value, one.} \item{mode}{The type of the
#' eigenproblem to be solved.  Possible values if the input matrix is

#' Eigenvector centrality of vertices
#'
#' `eigen_centrality()` takes a graph (`graph`) and returns the
#' eigenvector centralities of the vertices `v` within it.
#'
#' Eigenvector centrality scores correspond to the values of the principal
#' eigenvector of the graph's adjacency matrix; these scores may, in turn, be
#' interpreted as arising from a reciprocal process in which the centrality of
#' each actor is proportional to the sum of the centralities of those actors to
#' whom he or she is connected.  In general, vertices with high eigenvector
#' centralities are those which are connected to many other vertices which are,
#' in turn, connected to many others (and so on).  The perceptive may realize
#' that this implies that the largest values will be obtained by individuals in
#' large cliques (or high-density substructures).  This is also intelligible
#' from an algebraic point of view, with the first eigenvector being closely
#' related to the best rank-1 approximation of the adjacency matrix (a
#' relationship which is easy to see in the special case of a diagonalizable
#' symmetric real matrix via the \eqn{SLS^-1}{$S \Lambda S^{-1}$}
#' decomposition).
#'
#' The adjacency matrix used in the eigenvector centrality calculation assumes
#' that loop edges are counted *twice* in undirected graphs; this is because
#' each loop edge has *two* endpoints that are both connected to the same vertex,
#' and you could traverse the loop edge via either endpoint.
#'
#' In the directed case, the left eigenvector of the adjacency matrix is
#' calculated. In other words, the centrality of a vertex is proportional to
#' the sum of centralities of vertices pointing to it.
#'
#' Eigenvector centrality is meaningful only for (strongly) connected graphs.
#' Undirected graphs that are not connected should be decomposed into connected
#' components, and the eigenvector centrality calculated for each separately.
#' This function does not verify that the graph is connected. If it is not, in
#' the undirected case the scores of all but one component will be zeros.
#'
#' Also note that the adjacency matrix of a directed acyclic graph or the
#' adjacency matrix of an empty graph does not possess positive eigenvalues,
#' therefore the eigenvector centrality is not defined for these graphs.
#' igraph will return an eigenvalue of zero in such cases. The eigenvector
#' centralities will all be equal for an empty graph and will all be zeros for
#' a directed acyclic graph. Such pathological cases can be detected by checking
#' whether the eigenvalue is very close to zero.
#'
#' From igraph version 0.5 this function uses ARPACK for the underlying
#' computation, see [arpack()] for more about ARPACK in igraph.
#'
#' @param graph Graph to be analyzed.
#' @param directed Logical scalar, whether to consider direction of the edges
#'   in directed graphs. It is ignored for undirected graphs.
#' @param scale `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")` Normalization will always take
#' place.
#' @param weights A numerical vector or `NULL`. This argument can be used
#'   to give edge weights for calculating the weighted eigenvector centrality of
#'   vertices. If this is `NULL` and the graph has a `weight` edge
#'   attribute then that is used. If `weights` is a numerical vector then it is
#'   used, even if the graph has a `weight` edge attribute. If this is
#'   `NA`, then no edge weights are used (even if the graph has a
#'   `weight` edge attribute). Note that if there are negative edge weights
#'   and the direction of the edges is considered, then the eigenvector might be
#'   complex. In this case only the real part is reported.
#'   This function interprets weights as connection strength. Higher
#'   weights spread the centrality better.
#' @param options A named list, to override some ARPACK options. See
#'   [arpack()] for details.
#' @return A named list with components: \item{vector}{A vector containing the

#' The Page Rank algorithm
#'
#' Calculates the Google PageRank for the specified vertices.
#'
#' For the explanation of the PageRank algorithm, see the following webpage:
#' <http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html>, or the following
#' reference:
#'
#' Sergey Brin and Larry Page: The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web
#' Search Engine. Proceedings of the 7th World-Wide Web Conference, Brisbane,
#' Australia, April 1998.
#'
#' The `page_rank()` function can use either the PRPACK library or ARPACK
#' (see [arpack()]) to perform the calculation.
#'
#' Please note that the PageRank of a given vertex depends on the PageRank of
#' all other vertices, so even if you want to calculate the PageRank for only
#' some of the vertices, all of them must be calculated. Requesting the
#' PageRank for only some of the vertices does not result in any performance
#' increase at all.
#'
#' @param graph The graph object.
#' @param algo Character scalar, which implementation to use to carry out the
#'   calculation. The default is `"prpack"`, which uses the PRPACK library
#'   (<https://github.com/dgleich/prpack>) to calculate PageRank scores
#'   by solving a set of linear equations. This is a new implementation in igraph
#'   version 0.7, and the suggested one, as it is the most stable and the fastest
#'   for all but small graphs.  `"arpack"` uses the ARPACK library, the
#'   default implementation from igraph version 0.5 until version 0.7. It computes
#'   PageRank scores by solving an eingevalue problem.
#' @param vids The vertices of interest.
#' @param directed Logical, if true directed paths will be considered for
#'   directed graphs. It is ignored for undirected graphs.
#' @param damping The damping factor (\sQuote{d} in the original paper).
#' @param personalized Optional vector giving a probability distribution to
#'   calculate personalized PageRank. For personalized PageRank, the probability
#'   of jumping to a node when abandoning the random walk is not uniform, but it
#'   is given by this vector. The vector should contains an entry for each vertex
#'   and it will be rescaled to sum up to one.
#' @param weights A numerical vector or `NULL`. This argument can be used
#'   to give edge weights for calculating the weighted PageRank of vertices. If
#'   this is `NULL` and the graph has a `weight` edge attribute then
#'   that is used. If `weights` is a numerical vector then it used, even if
#'   the graph has a `weights` edge attribute. If this is `NA`, then no
#'   edge weights are used (even if the graph has a `weight` edge attribute.
#'   This function interprets edge weights as connection strengths. In the
#'   random surfer model, an edge with a larger weight is more likely to be
#'   selected by the surfer.
#' @param options A named list, to override some ARPACK options. See
#'   [arpack()] for details. This argument is ignored if the PRPACK
#'   implementation is used.
#' @return A named list with entries: \item{vector}{A
#'   numeric vector with the PageRank scores.} \item{value}{When using the ARPACK
#'   method, the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector with the PageRank scores
#'   is returned here. It is expected to be exactly one, and can be used to check
#'   that ARPACK has successfully converged to the expected eingevector. When using
#'   the PRPACK method, it is always set to 1.0.} \item{options}{Some information

#' Harmonic centrality of vertices
#'
#' The harmonic centrality of a vertex is the mean inverse distance to all other
#' vertices. The inverse distance to an unreachable vertex is considered to be zero.
#'
#' The `cutoff` argument can be used to restrict the calculation to paths
#' of length `cutoff` or smaller only; this can be used for larger graphs
#' to speed up the calculation. If `cutoff` is negative (which is the
#' default), then the function calculates the exact harmonic centrality scores.
#'
#' @param graph The graph to analyze.
#' @param vids The vertices for which harmonic centrality will be calculated.
#' @param mode Character string, defining the types of the paths used for
#'   measuring the distance in directed graphs. \dQuote{out} follows paths along
#'   the edge directions only, \dQuote{in} traverses the edges in reverse, while
#'   \dQuote{all} ignores edge directions. This argument is ignored for undirected
#'   graphs.
#' @param normalized Logical scalar, whether to calculate the normalized
#'   harmonic centrality. If true, the result is the mean inverse path length to
#'   other vertices, i.e. it is normalized by the number of vertices minus one.
#'   If false, the result is the sum of inverse path lengths to other vertices.
#' @param weights Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
#'   harmonic centrality. If the graph has a `weight` edge attribute, then
#'   this is used by default. Weights are used for calculating weighted shortest
#'   paths, so they are interpreted as distances.
#' @param cutoff The maximum path length to consider when calculating the
#'   harmonic centrality. There is no such limit when the cutoff is negative. Note that
#'   zero cutoff means that only paths of at most length 0 are considered.
#' @return Numeric vector with the harmonic centrality scores of all the vertices in
#'   `v`.

#' Find Bonacich Power Centrality Scores of Network Positions
#'
#' `power_centrality()` takes a graph (`dat`) and returns the Boncich power
#' centralities of positions (selected by `nodes`).  The decay rate for
#' power contributions is specified by `exponent` (1 by default).
#'
#' Bonacich's power centrality measure is defined by
#' \eqn{C_{BP}\left(\alpha,\beta\right)=\alpha\left(\mathbf{I}-\beta\mathbf{A}\right)^{-1}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{1}}{C_BP(alpha,beta)=alpha
#' (I-beta A)^-1 A 1}, where \eqn{\beta}{beta} is an attenuation parameter (set
#' here by `exponent`) and \eqn{\mathbf{A}}{A} is the graph adjacency
#' matrix.  (The coefficient \eqn{\alpha}{alpha} acts as a scaling parameter,
#' and is set here (following Bonacich (1987)) such that the sum of squared
#' scores is equal to the number of vertices.  This allows 1 to be used as a
#' reference value for the ``middle'' of the centrality range.)  When
#' \eqn{\beta \rightarrow }{beta->1/lambda_A1}\eqn{
#' 1/\lambda_{\mathbf{A}1}}{beta->1/lambda_A1} (the reciprocal of the largest
#' eigenvalue of \eqn{\mathbf{A}}{A}), this is to within a constant multiple of
#' the familiar eigenvector centrality score; for other values of \eqn{\beta},
#' the behavior of the measure is quite different.  In particular, \eqn{\beta}
#' gives positive and negative weight to even and odd walks, respectively, as
#' can be seen from the series expansion
#' \eqn{C_{BP}\left(\alpha,\beta\right)=\alpha \sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta^k
#' }{C_BP(alpha,beta) = alpha sum( beta^k A^(k+1) 1, k in 0..infinity )}\eqn{
#' \mathbf{A}^{k+1} \mathbf{1}}{C_BP(alpha,beta) = alpha sum( beta^k A^(k+1) 1,
#' k in 0..infinity )} which converges so long as \eqn{|\beta|
#' }{|beta|<1/lambda_A1}\eqn{ < 1/\lambda_{\mathbf{A}1}}{|beta|<1/lambda_A1}.
#' The magnitude of \eqn{\beta}{beta} controls the influence of distant actors
#' on ego's centrality score, with larger magnitudes indicating slower rates of
#' decay.  (High rates, hence, imply a greater sensitivity to edge effects.)
#'
#' Interpretively, the Bonacich power measure corresponds to the notion that
#' the power of a vertex is recursively defined by the sum of the power of its
#' alters.  The nature of the recursion involved is then controlled by the
#' power exponent: positive values imply that vertices become more powerful as
#' their alters become more powerful (as occurs in cooperative relations),
#' while negative values imply that vertices become more powerful only as their
#' alters become *weaker* (as occurs in competitive or antagonistic
#' relations).  The magnitude of the exponent indicates the tendency of the
#' effect to decay across long walks; higher magnitudes imply slower decay.
#' One interesting feature of this measure is its relative instability to
#' changes in exponent magnitude (particularly in the negative case).  If your
#' theory motivates use of this measure, you should be very careful to choose a
#' decay parameter on a non-ad hoc basis.
#'
#' For directed networks, the Bonacich power measure can be understood as
#' similar to status in the network where higher status nodes have more edges
#' that point from them to others with status. Node A's centrality depends
#' on the centrality of all the nodes that A points toward, and their centrality
#' depends on the nodes they point toward, etc. Note, this means that a node
#' with an out-degree of 0 will have a Bonacich power centrality of 0 as they
#' do not point towards anyone. When using this with directed network it
#' is important to think about the edge direction and what it represents.
#'
#' @param graph the input graph.
#' @param nodes vertex sequence indicating which vertices are to be included in
#'   the calculation.  By default, all vertices are included.
#' @param loops boolean indicating whether or not the diagonal should be
#'   treated as valid data.  Set this true if and only if the data can contain
#'   loops.  `loops` is `FALSE` by default.

#' Find Bonacich alpha centrality scores of network positions
#'
#' `alpha_centrality()` calculates the alpha centrality of some (or all)
#' vertices in a graph.
#'
#' The alpha centrality measure can be considered as a generalization of
#' eigenvector centrality to directed graphs. It was proposed by Bonacich in
#' 2001 (see reference below).
#'
#' The alpha centrality of the vertices in a graph is defined as the solution
#' of the following matrix equation: \deqn{x=\alpha A^T x+e,}{x=alpha t(A)x+e,}
#' where \eqn{A}{A} is the (not necessarily symmetric) adjacency matrix of the
#' graph, \eqn{e}{e} is the vector of exogenous sources of status of the
#' vertices and \eqn{\alpha}{alpha} is the relative importance of the
#' endogenous versus exogenous factors.
#'
#' @param graph The input graph, can be directed or undirected. In undirected
#'   graphs, edges are treated as if they were reciprocal directed ones.
#' @param nodes Vertex sequence, the vertices for which the alpha centrality
#'   values are returned. (For technical reasons they will be calculated for all
#'   vertices, anyway.)
#' @param alpha Parameter specifying the relative importance of endogenous
#'   versus exogenous factors in the determination of centrality. See details
#'   below.
#' @param loops Whether to eliminate loop edges from the graph before the
#'   calculation.
#' @param exo The exogenous factors, in most cases this is either a constant --
#'   the same factor for every node, or a vector giving the factor for every
#'   vertex. Note that too long vectors will be truncated and too short vectors
#'   will be replicated to match the number of vertices.
#' @param weights A character scalar that gives the name of the edge attribute
#'   to use in the adjacency matrix. If it is `NULL`, then the
#'   \sQuote{weight} edge attribute of the graph is used, if there is one.
#'   Otherwise, or if it is `NA`, then the calculation uses the standard
