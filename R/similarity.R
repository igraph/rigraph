#' Similarity measures of two vertices
#'
#' These functions calculates similarity scores for vertices based on their
#' connection patterns.
#'
#' @details
#' The Jaccard similarity coefficient of two vertices is the number of common
#' neighbors divided by the number of vertices that are neighbors of at least
#' one of the two vertices being considered. The `jaccard` method
#' calculates the pairwise Jaccard similarities for some (or all) of the
#' vertices.
#'
#' The Dice similarity coefficient of two vertices is twice the number of
#' common neighbors divided by the sum of the degrees of the vertices.
#' Methof `dice` calculates the pairwise Dice similarities for some
#' (or all) of the vertices.
#'
#' The inverse log-weighted similarity of two vertices is the number of their
#' common neighbors, weighted by the inverse logarithm of their degrees.  It is
#' based on the assumption that two vertices should be considered more similar
#' if they share a low-degree common neighbor, since high-degree common
#' neighbors are more likely to appear even by pure chance.  Isolated vertices
#' will have zero similarity to any other vertex.  Self-similarities are not
#' calculated.  See the following paper for more details: Lada A. Adamic and
#' Eytan Adar: Friends and neighbors on the Web. Social Networks,
#' 25(3):211-230, 2003.

#' @aliases similarity.jaccard similarity.dice similarity.invlogweighted
#' @param graph The input graph.
#' @param vids The vertex ids for which the similarity is calculated.
#' @param mode The type of neighboring vertices to use for the calculation,
#'   possible values: \sQuote{`out`}, \sQuote{`in`},
#'   \sQuote{`all`}.
#' @param loops Whether to include vertices themselves in the neighbor
#'   sets.
#' @param method The method to use.
#' @return A `length(vids)` by `length(vids)` numeric matrix
#'   containing the similarity scores. This argument is ignored by the
#'   `invlogweighted` method.
