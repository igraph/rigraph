#' Finds a cycle in a graph, if there is one
#'
#' @description
#' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#'
#' This function returns a cycle of the graph, in terms of both its vertices
#' and edges. If the graph is acyclic, it returns empty vertex and edge
#' sequences.
#'
#' Use [is_acyclic()] to determine if a graph has cycles, without returning
#' a specific cycle.
#'
#' @param graph The input graph.
#' @param mode Character constant specifying how to handle directed graphs.
#'   `out` follows edge directions, `in` follows edges in the reverse direction,
#'   and `all` ignores edge directions. Ignored in undirected graphs.
#' @return A list of integer vectors, each integer vector is a path from
#'   the source vertex to one of the target vertices. A path is given by its
#'   vertex ids.

#' Finds all simple cycles in a graph.
#'
#' @description
#' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#'
#' This function lists all simple cycles in a graph within a range of cycle
#' lengths. A cycle is called simple if it has no repeated vertices.
#'
#' Multi-edges and self-loops are taken into account. Note that typical graphs
#' have exponentially many cycles and the presence of multi-edges exacerbates
#' this combinatorial explosion.
#'
#' @inheritParams find_cycle
#' @param min Lower limit on cycle lengths to consider. `NULL` means no limit.
#' @param max Upper limit on cycle lengths to consider. `NULL` means no limit.
#' @return A named list, with two entries:
#' \item{vertices}{The list of cycles in terms of their vertices.}
#' \item{edges}{The list of cycles in terms of their edges.}
#' @keywords graphs
