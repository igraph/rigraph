#' The igraph package
#' 
#' igraph is a library and R package for network analysis.
#' 
#' @rdname aaa-igraph-package
#' @name igraph-package
#' @aliases igraph-package igraph
#' @docType package
#'
#' @section Introduction:
#' The main goals of the igraph library is to provide a set of data types
#' and functions for 1) pain-free implementation of graph algorithms, 2)
#' fast handling of large graphs, with millions of vertices and edges, 3)
#' allowing rapid prototyping via high level languages like R.
#' 
#' @section igraph graphs:
#'   igraph graphs have a class \sQuote{\code{igraph}}. They are printed to
#'   the screen in a special format, here is an example, a ring graph
#'   created using \code{\link{make_ring}}: \preformatted{
#'     IGRAPH U--- 10 10 -- Ring graph
#'     + attr: name (g/c), mutual (g/x), circular (g/x)  }
#'   \sQuote{\code{IGRAPH}} denotes that this is an igraph graph. Then
#'   come four bits that denote the kind of the graph: the first is
#'   \sQuote{\code{U}} for undirected and \sQuote{\code{D}} for directed
#'   graphs. The second is \sQuote{\code{N}} for named graph (i.e. if the
#'   graph has the \sQuote{\code{name}} vertex attribute set). The third is
#'   \sQuote{\code{W}} for weighted graphs (i.e. if the
#'   \sQuote{\code{weight}} edge attribute is set). The fourth is
#'   \sQuote{\code{B}} for bipartite graphs (i.e. if the
#'   \sQuote{\code{type}} vertex attribute is set).
#' 
#'   Then come two numbers, the number of vertices and the number of edges
#'   in the graph, and after a double dash, the name of the graph (the
#'   \sQuote{\code{name}} graph attribute) is printed if present. The
#'   second line is optional and it contains all the attributes of the
#'   graph. This graph has a \sQuote{\code{name}} graph attribute, of type
#'   character, and two other graph attributes called
#'   \sQuote{\code{mutual}} and \sQuote{\code{circular}}, of a complex
#'   type. A complex type is simply anything that is not numeric or
#'   character. See the documentation of \code{\link{print.igraph}} for
#'   details.
#' 
#'   If you want to see the edges of the graph as well, then use the
#'   \code{\link{print_all}} function: \preformatted{    > print_all(g)
#'     IGRAPH badcafe U--- 10 10 -- Ring graph
#'     + attr: name (g/c), mutual (g/x), circular (g/x)
#'     + edges:
#'      [1] 1-- 2 2-- 3 3-- 4 4-- 5 5-- 6 6-- 7 7-- 8 8-- 9 9--10 1--10 }
#'
#' @section Creating graphs:
#'   There are many functions in igraph for creating graphs, both
#'   deterministic and stochastic; stochastic graph constructors are called
#'   \sQuote{games}.
#' 
#'   To create small graphs with a given structure probably the
#'   \code{\link{graph_from_literal}} function is easiest. It uses R's formula
#'   interface, its manual page contains many examples. Another option is
#'   \code{\link{graph}}, which takes numeric vertex ids directly.
#'   \code{\link{graph_from_atlas}} creates graph from the Graph Atlas,
#'   \code{\link{make_graph}} can create some special graphs.
#' 
#'   To create graphs from field data, \code{\link{graph_from_edgelist}},
#'   \code{\link{graph_from_data_frame}} and \code{\link{graph_from_adjacency_matrix}} are
#'   probably the best choices.
#' 
#'   The igraph package includes some classic random graphs like the
#'   Erdos-Renyi GNP and GNM graphs (\code{\link{sample_gnp}}, \code{\link{sample_gnm}}) and
#'   some recent  popular models, like preferential attachment
#'   (\code{\link{sample_pa}}) and the small-world model
#'   (\code{\link{sample_smallworld}}). 
#'
#' @section Vertex and edge IDs:
#'   Vertices and edges have numerical vertex ids in igraph. Vertex ids are
#'   always consecutive and they start with one. I.e. for a graph with
#'   \eqn{n} vertices the vertex ids are between \eqn{1} and
#'   \eqn{n}. If some operation changes the number of vertices in the
#'   graphs, e.g. a subgraph is created via \code{\link{induced_subgraph}}, then
#'   the vertices are renumbered to satisfy this criteria.
#' 
#'   The same is true for the edges as well, edge ids are always between
#'   one and \eqn{m}, the total number of edges in the graph.
#' 
#'   It is often desirable to follow vertices along a number of graph
#'   operations, and vertex ids don't allow this because of the
#'   renumbering. The solution is to assign attributes to the
#'   vertices. These are kept by all operations, if possible. See more
#'   about attributes in the next section.
#'
#' @section Attributes:
#'   In igraph it is possible to assign attributes to the vertices or edges
#'   of a graph, or to the graph itself. igraph provides flexible
#'   constructs for selecting a set of vertices or edges based on their
#'   attribute values, see \code{\link{vertex_attr}},
#'   \code{\link{V}} and \code{\link{E}} for details.
#' 
#'   Some vertex/edge/graph attributes are treated specially. One of them
#'   is the \sQuote{name} attribute. This is used for printing the graph
#'   instead of the numerical ids, if it exists. Vertex names can also be
#'   used to specify a vector or set of vertices, in all igraph
#'   functions. E.g. \code{\link{degree}} has a \code{v} argument
#'   that gives the vertices for which the degree is calculated. This
#'   argument can be given as a character vector of vertex names.
#' 
#'   Edges can also have a \sQuote{name} attribute, and this is treated
#'   specially as well. Just like for vertices, edges can also be selected
#'   based on their names, e.g. in the \code{\link{delete_edges}} and
#'   other functions.
#' 
#'   We note here, that vertex names can also be used to select edges.
#'   The form \sQuote{\code{from|to}}, where \sQuote{\code{from}} and
#'   \sQuote{\code{to}} are vertex names, select a single, possibly
#'   directed, edge going from \sQuote{\code{from}} to
#'   \sQuote{\code{to}}. The two forms can also be mixed in the same edge
#'   selector.
#'   
#'   Other attributes define visualization parameters, see
#'   \code{\link{igraph.plotting}} for details.
#' 
#'   Attribute values can be set to any R object, but note that storing the
#'   graph in some file formats might result the loss of complex attribute
#'   values. All attribute values are preserved if you use
#'   \code{\link[base]{save}} and \code{\link[base]{load}} to store/retrieve your
#'   graphs.
#'
#' @section Visualization:
#'   igraph provides three different ways for visualization. The first is
#'   the \code{\link{plot.igraph}} function. (Actually you don't need to
#'   write \code{plot.igraph}, \code{plot} is enough. This function uses
#'   regular R graphics and can be used with any R device.
#' 
#'   The second function is \code{\link{tkplot}}, which uses a Tk GUI for
#'   basic interactive graph manipulation. (Tk is quite resource hungry, so
#'   don't try this for very large graphs.)
#' 
#'   The third way requires the \code{rgl} package and uses OpenGL. See the
#'   \code{\link{rglplot}} function for the details.
#' 
#'   Make sure you read \code{\link{igraph.plotting}} before you start
#'   plotting your graphs.
#'
#' @section File formats:
#'   igraph can handle various graph file formats, usually both for reading
#'   and writing. We suggest that you use the GraphML file format for your
#'   graphs, except if the graphs are too big. For big graphs a simpler
#'   format is recommended. See \code{\link{read_graph}} and
#'   \code{\link{write_graph}} for details.

#'   \url{https://igraph.discourse.group} if you have questions or comments.
