#' Simple graphs
#'
#' Simple graphs are graphs which do not contain loop and multiple edges.
#'
#' A loop edge is an edge for which the two endpoints are the same
#' vertex. Two edges are multiple edges if they have exactly the same two
#' endpoints (for directed graphs order does matter). A graph is simple is
#' it does not contain loop edges and multiple edges.
#'
#' `is_simple()` checks whether a graph is simple.
#'
#' `simplify()` removes the loop and/or multiple edges from a graph.  If
#' both `remove.loops` and `remove.multiple` are `TRUE` the
#' function returns a simple graph.
#'
#' `simplify_and_colorize()` constructs a new, simple graph from a graph and
#' also sets a `color` attribute on both the vertices and the edges.
#' The colors of the vertices represent the number of self-loops that were
#' originally incident on them, while the colors of the edges represent the
#' multiplicities of the same edges in the original graph. This allows one to
#' take into account the edge multiplicities and the number of loop edges in
#' the VF2 isomorphism algorithm. Other graph, vertex and edge attributes from
#' the original graph are discarded as the primary purpose of this function is
#' to facilitate the usage of multigraphs with the VF2 algorithm.
#'
#' @aliases simplify is.simple is_simple simplify_and_colorize
#' @param graph The graph to work on.
#' @param remove.loops Logical, whether the loop edges are to be removed.
#' @param remove.multiple Logical, whether the multiple edges are to be
#'   removed.
#' @param edge.attr.comb Specifies what to do with edge attributes, if
#'   `remove.multiple=TRUE`. In this case many edges might be mapped to a
#'   single one in the new graph, and their attributes are combined. Please see
#'   [attribute.combination()] for details on this.
#' @return a new graph object with the edges deleted.
