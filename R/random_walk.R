#' Random walk on a graph
#'
#' `random_walk()` performs a random walk on the graph and returns the
#' vertices that the random walk passed through. `random_edge_walk()`
#' is the same but returns the edges that that random walk passed through.
#'
#' Do a random walk. From the given start vertex, take the given number of
#' steps, choosing an edge from the actual vertex uniformly randomly. Edge
#' directions are observed in directed graphs (see the `mode` argument
#' as well). Multiple and loop edges are also observed.
#'
#' @param graph The input graph, might be undirected or directed.
#' @param start The start vertex.
#' @param steps The number of steps to make.
#' @param weights The edge weights. Larger edge weights increase the
#'   probability that an edge is selected by the random walker. In other
#'   words, larger edge weights correspond to stronger connections. The
#'   \sQuote{weight} edge attribute is used if present. Supply
#'   \sQuote{`NA`} here if you want to ignore the \sQuote{weight} edge
#'   attribute.
#' @param mode How to follow directed edges. `"out"` steps along the
#'   edge direction, `"in"` is opposite to that. `"all"` ignores
#'   edge directions. This argument is ignored for undirected graphs.
#' @param stuck What to do if the random walk gets stuck. `"return"`
#'   returns the partial walk, `"error"` raises an error.
#' @return For `random_walk()`, a vertex sequence containing the vertices
#'   along the walk. For `random_edge_walk()`, an edge sequence containing
#'   the edges along the walk.
