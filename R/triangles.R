#' Find triangles in graphs
#'
#' Count how many triangles a vertex is part of, in a graph, or just list the
#' triangles of a graph.
#'
#' `triangles()` lists all triangles of a graph. For efficiency, all
#' triangles are returned in a single vector. The first three vertices belong
#' to the first triangle, etc.
#'
#' `count_triangles()` counts how many triangles a vertex is part of.
#'
#' @aliases triangles
#' @param graph The input graph. It might be directed, but edge directions are
#'   ignored.
#' @param vids The vertices to query, all of them by default. This might be a
#'   vector of numeric ids, or a character vector of symbolic vertex names for
#'   named graphs.
#' @return For `triangles()` a numeric vector of vertex ids, the first three
#'   vertices belong to the first triangle found, etc.
#'
#'   For `count_triangles()` a numeric vector, the number of triangles for all
#'   vertices queried.

#' ## Should match, local transitivity is the
