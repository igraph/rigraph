#' SIR model on graphs
#' 
#' Run simulations for an SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model, on a
#' graph
#' 
#' The SIR model is a simple model from epidemiology. The individuals of the
#' population might be in three states: susceptible, infected and recovered.
#' Recovered people are assumed to be immune to the disease. Susceptibles
#' become infected with a rate that depends on their number of infected
#' neighbors. Infected people become recovered with a constant rate.
#' 
#' The function \code{sir} simulates the model.
#' 
#' Function \code{time_bins} bins the simulation steps, using the
#' Freedman-Diaconis heuristics to determine the bin width.
#' 
#' Function \code{median} and \code{quantile} calculate the median and
#' quantiles of the results, respectively, in bins calculated with
#' \code{time_bins}.
#' 
#' @aliases median.sir quantile.sir time_bins time_bins.sir sir
#' @param graph The graph to run the model on. If directed, then edge
#' directions are ignored and a warning is given.
#' @param beta Non-negative scalar. The rate of infection of an individual that
#' is susceptible and has a single infected neighbor. The infection rate of a
#' susceptible individual with n infected neighbors is n times beta. Formally
#' this is the rate parameter of an exponential distribution.
#' @param gamma Positive scalar. The rate of recovery of an infected
#' individual. Formally, this is the rate parameter of an exponential
#' distribution.
#' @param no.sim Integer scalar, the number simulation runs to perform.
#' @param x A \code{sir} object, returned by the \code{sir} function.
#' @param middle Logical scalar, whether to return the middle of the time bins,
#' or the boundaries.
#' @param na.rm Logical scalar, whether to ignore \code{NA} values.  \code{sir}
#' objects do not contain any \code{NA} values currently, so this argument is
#' effectively ignored.
#' @param comp Character scalar. The component to calculate the quantile of.
#' \code{NI} is infected agents, \code{NS} is susceptibles, \code{NR} stands
#' for recovered.
#' @param prob Numeric vector of probabilities, in [0,1], they specify the
#' quantiles to calculate.
#' @param \dots Additional arguments, ignored currently.
#' @return For \code{sir} the results are returned in an object of class
#' \sQuote{\code{sir}}, which is a list, with one element for each simulation.
#' Each simulation is itself a list with the following elements. They are all
#' numeric vectors, with equal length: \describe{
#'   \item{times}{The times of the events.}
#'   \item{NS}{The number of susceptibles in the population, over time.}
#'   \item{NI}{The number of infected individuals in the population, over
#'     time.}
#'   \item{NR}{The number of recovered individuals in the population, over
#'     time.}
#' } 
#' 
#' Function \code{time_bins} returns a numeric vector, the middle or the
#' boundaries of the time bins, depending on the \code{middle} argument.
#' 
#' \code{median} returns a list of three named numeric vectors, \code{NS},
#' \code{NI} and \code{NR}. The names within the vectors are created from the
#' time bins.
#' 
#' \code{quantile} returns the same vector as \code{median} (but only one, the
#' one requested) if only one quantile is requested. If multiple quantiles are
#' requested, then a list of these vectors is returned, one for each quantile.
