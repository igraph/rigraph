#' Assortativity coefficient
#'
#' The assortativity coefficient is positive if similar vertices (based on some
#' external property) tend to connect to each, and negative otherwise.
#'
#' The assortativity coefficient measures the level of homophyly of the graph,
#' based on some vertex labeling or values assigned to vertices. If the
#' coefficient is high, that means that connected vertices tend to have the
#' same labels or similar assigned values.
#'
#' M.E.J. Newman defined two kinds of assortativity coefficients, the first one
#' is for categorical labels of vertices. `assortativity_nominal()`
#' calculates this measure. It is defined as
#'
#' \deqn{r=\frac{\sum_i e_{ii}-\sum_i a_i b_i}{1-\sum_i a_i b_i}}{
#' r=(sum(e(i,i), i) - sum(a(i)b(i), i)) / (1 - sum(a(i)b(i), i))}
#'
#' where \eqn{e_{ij}}{e(i,j)} is the fraction of edges connecting vertices of
#' type \eqn{i} and \eqn{j}, \eqn{a_i=\sum_j e_{ij}}{a(i)=sum(e(i,j), j)} and
#' \eqn{b_j=\sum_i e_{ij}}{b(j)=sum(e(i,j), i)}.
#'
#' The second assortativity variant is based on values assigned to the
#' vertices. `assortativity()` calculates this measure. It is defined as
#'
#' \deqn{r=\frac1{\sigma_q^2}\sum_{jk} jk(e_{jk}-q_j q_k)}{
#' sum(jk(e(j,k)-q(j)q(k)), j, k) / sigma(q)^2}
#'
#' for undirected graphs (\eqn{q_i=\sum_j e_{ij}}{q(i)=sum(e(i,j), j)}) and as
#'
#' \deqn{r=\frac1{\sigma_o\sigma_i}\sum_{jk}jk(e_{jk}-q_j^o q_k^i)}{
#' sum(jk(e(j,k)-qout(j)qin(k)), j, k) / sigma(qin) / sigma(qout) }
#'
#' for directed ones. Here \eqn{q_i^o=\sum_j e_{ij}}{qout(i)=sum(e(i,j), j)},
#' \eqn{q_i^i=\sum_j e_{ji}}{qin(i)=sum(e(j,i), j)}, moreover,
#' \eqn{\sigma_q}{\sigma(q)}, \eqn{\sigma_o}{\sigma(qout)} and
#' \eqn{\sigma_i}{\sigma(qin)} are the standard deviations of \eqn{q},
#' \eqn{q^o}{qout} and \eqn{q^i}{qin}, respectively.
#'
#' The reason of the difference is that in directed networks the relationship
#' is not symmetric, so it is possible to assign different values to the
#' outgoing and the incoming end of the edges.
#'
#' `assortativity_degree()` uses vertex degree as vertex values
#' and calls `assortativity()`.
#'
#' Undirected graphs are effectively treated as directed ones with all-reciprocal edges.
#' Thus, self-loops are taken into account twice in undirected graphs.
#'
#' @aliases assortativity
#' @param graph The input graph, it can be directed or undirected.
#' @param values The vertex values, these can be arbitrary numeric values.
#' @inheritParams rlang::args_dots_empty
#' @param values.in A second value vector to use for the incoming edges when
#'   calculating assortativity for a directed graph.
#'   Supply `NULL` here if
#'   you want to use the same values for outgoing and incoming edges.
#'   This
#'   argument is ignored (with a warning) if it is not `NULL` and undirected
#'   assortativity coefficient is being calculated.
#' @param directed Logical scalar, whether to consider edge directions for
#'   directed graphs.
#'   This argument is ignored for undirected graphs.
#'   Supply
#'   `TRUE` here to do the natural thing, i.e. use directed version of the
#'   measure for directed graphs and the undirected version for undirected
#'   graphs.
#' @param normalized Boolean, whether to compute the normalized assortativity.
#' The non-normalized nominal assortativity is identical to modularity.
#' The non-normalized value-based assortativity is simply the covariance of the
#' values at the two ends of edges.
#' @param types1,types2
#'   `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")`
#'   Deprecated aliases for `values` and `values.in`, respectively.
#' @return A single real number.
