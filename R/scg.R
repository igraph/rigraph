#' Spectral Coarse Graining
#'
#' Functions to perform the Spectral Coarse Graining (SCG) of matrices and
#' graphs.
#'
#' @name scg-method
#' @family scg
#' @section Introduction: The SCG functions provide a framework, called
#' Spectral Coarse Graining (SCG), for reducing large graphs while preserving
#' their *spectral-related features*, that is features closely related
#' with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a graph matrix (which for now can
#' be the adjacency, the stochastic, or the Laplacian matrix).
#'
#' Common examples of such features comprise the first-passage-time of random
#' walkers on Markovian graphs, thermodynamic properties of lattice models in
#' statistical physics (e.g. Ising model), and the epidemic threshold of
#' epidemic network models (SIR and SIS models).
#'
#' SCG differs from traditional clustering schemes by producing a
#' *coarse-grained graph* (not just a partition of the vertices),
#' representative of the original one. As shown in \[1\], Principal Component
#' Analysis can be viewed as a particular SCG, called *exact SCG*, where
#' the matrix to be coarse-grained is the covariance matrix of some data set.
#'
#' SCG should be of interest to practitioners of various fields dealing with
#' problems where matrix eigenpairs play an important role, as for instance is
#' the case of dynamical processes on networks.

#' Stochastic matrix of a graph
#'
#' Retrieves the stochastic matrix of a graph of class `igraph`.
#'
#' Let \eqn{M} be an \eqn{n \times n}{n x n} adjacency matrix with real
#' non-negative entries. Let us define \eqn{D = \textrm{diag}(\sum_{i}M_{1i},
#' \dots, \sum_{i}M_{ni})}{D=diag( sum(M[1,i], i), ..., sum(M[n,i], i) )}
#'
#' The (row) stochastic matrix is defined as \deqn{W = D^{-1}M,}{W = inv(D) M,}
#' where it is assumed that \eqn{D} is non-singular.  Column stochastic
#' matrices are defined in a symmetric way.
#'
#' @aliases get.stochastic
#' @param graph The input graph. Must be of class `igraph`.
#' @param column.wise If `FALSE`, then the rows of the stochastic matrix
#'   sum up to one; otherwise it is the columns.
#' @param sparse Logical scalar, whether to return a sparse matrix. The
#'   `Matrix` package is needed for sparse matrices.
#' @return A regular matrix or a matrix of class `Matrix` if a
#'   `sparse` argument was `TRUE`.
