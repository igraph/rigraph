#' igraph data structure versions
#'
#' igraph's internal data representation changes sometimes between
#' versions. This means that it is not possible to use igraph objects
#' that were created (and possibly saved to a file) with an older
#' igraph version.
#'
#' \code{graph_version} queries the current data format,
#' or the data format of a possibly older igraph graph.
#'
#' \code{\link{upgrade_graph}} can convert an older data format
#' to the current one.
#'
#' @param graph The input graph. If it is missing, then
#'   the version number of the current data format is returned.
#' @return A character scalar.
