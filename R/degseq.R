#' Check if a degree sequence is valid for a multi-graph
#'
#' `is_degseq()` checks whether the given vertex degrees (in- and
#' out-degrees for directed graphs) can be realized by a graph. Note that the
#' graph does not have to be simple, it may contain loop and multiple edges.
#' For undirected graphs, it also checks whether the sum of degrees is even.
#' For directed graphs, the function checks whether the lengths of the two
#' degree vectors are equal and whether their sums are also equal. These are
#' known sufficient and necessary conditions for a degree sequence to be valid.
#'
#' @aliases is_degseq
#' @param out.deg Integer vector, the degree sequence for undirected graphs, or
#'   the out-degree sequence for directed graphs.
#' @param in.deg `NULL` or an integer vector. For undirected graphs, it
#'   should be `NULL`. For directed graphs it specifies the in-degrees.
#' @return A logical scalar.

#' Is a degree sequence graphical?
#'
#' Determine whether the given vertex degrees (in- and out-degrees for
#' directed graphs) can be realized by a graph.
#'
#' The classical concept of graphicality assumes simple graphs. This function
#' can perform the check also when self-loops, multi-edges, or both are allowed
#' in the graph.
#'
#' @param out.deg Integer vector, the degree sequence for undirected graphs, or
#'   the out-degree sequence for directed graphs.
#' @param in.deg `NULL` or an integer vector. For undirected graphs, it
#'   should be `NULL`. For directed graphs it specifies the in-degrees.
#' @param allowed.edge.types The allowed edge types in the graph. \sQuote{simple}
#'   means that neither loop nor multiple edges are allowed (i.e. the graph must be
#'   simple). \sQuote{loops} means that loop edges are allowed but mutiple edges
#'   are not. \sQuote{multi} means that multiple edges are allowed but loop edges
#'   are not. \sQuote{all} means that both loop edges and multiple edges are
#'   allowed.
#' @return A logical scalar.
