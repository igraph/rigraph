#' Centralization of a graph
#'
#' Centralization is a method for creating a graph level centralization
#' measure from the centrality scores of the vertices.
#'
#' Centralization is a general method for calculating a graph-level
#' centrality score based on node-level centrality measure. The formula for
#' this is
#' \deqn{C(G)=\sum_v (\max_w c_w - c_v),}{ C(G)=sum(max(c(w), w) - c(v), v),}
#' where \eqn{c_v}{c(v)} is the centrality of vertex \eqn{v}.
#'
#' The graph-level centralization measure can be normalized by dividing by the
#' maximum theoretical score for a graph with the same number of vertices,
#' using the same parameters, e.g. directedness, whether we consider loop
#' edges, etc.
#'
#' For degree, closeness and betweenness the most centralized structure is
#' some version of the star graph, in-star, out-star or undirected star.
#'
#' For eigenvector centrality the most centralized structure is the graph
#' with a single edge (and potentially many isolates).
#'
#' `centralize()` implements general centralization formula to calculate
#' a graph-level score from vertex-level scores.
#'
#' @param scores The vertex level centrality scores.
#' @param theoretical.max Real scalar. The graph-level centralization measure of
#'   the most centralized graph with the same number of vertices as the graph
#'   under study. This is only used if the `normalized` argument is set
#'   to `TRUE`.
#' @param normalized Logical scalar. Whether to normalize the graph level
#'   centrality score by dividing by the supplied theoretical maximum.
#' @return A real scalar, the centralization of the graph from which
#'   `scores` were derived.
