#' List all simple paths from one source
#'
#' This function lists all simple paths from one source vertex to another
#' vertex or vertices. A path is simple if contains no repeated vertices.
#'
#' Note that potentially there are exponentially many paths between two
#' vertices of a graph, and you may run out of memory when using this
#' function, if your graph is lattice-like.
#'
#' This function ignores multiple and loop edges.
#'
#' @param graph The input graph.
#' @param from The source vertex.
#' @param to The target vertex of vertices. Defaults to all vertices.
#' @param mode Character constant, gives whether the shortest paths to or
#'   from the given vertices should be calculated for directed graphs. If
#'   `out` then the shortest paths *from* the vertex, if `in`
#'   then *to* it will be considered. If `all`, the default, then
#'   the corresponding undirected graph will be used, i.e. not directed paths
#'   are searched. This argument is ignored for undirected graphs.
#' @param cutoff Maximum length of the paths that are considered. If negative,
#'   no cutoff is used.
#' @return A list of integer vectors, each integer vector is a path from
#'   the source vertex to one of the target vertices. A path is given by its
#'   vertex ids.

#' Maximum cardinality search
#'
#' Maximum cardinality search is a simple ordering a vertices that is useful in
#' determining the chordality of a graph.
#'
#' Maximum cardinality search visits the vertices in such an order that every
#' time the vertex with the most already visited neighbors is visited. Ties are
#' broken randomly.
#'
#' The algorithm provides a simple basis for deciding whether a graph is
#' chordal, see References below, and also [is_chordal()].
#'
#' @aliases max_cardinality
#' @param graph The input graph. It may be directed, but edge directions are
#'   ignored, as the algorithm is defined for undirected graphs.
#' @return A list with two components:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{alpha}{
#'       Numeric vector. The 1-based rank of each vertex in the graph
#'       such that the vertex with rank 1 is visited first,
#'       the vertex with rank 2 is visited second and so on.
#'     }
#'     \item{alpham1}{
#'       Numeric vector. The inverse of `alpha`.
#'       In other words, the elements of this vector are the vertices in reverse maximum cardinality search order.

#' Widest paths between vertices
#'
#' `widest_path_widths()` calculates the widths of all the widest paths from
#' or to the vertices in the network.
#' `widest_paths()` calculates one widest path (the path itself, and not just its width) from or to the
#' given vertex.
#'
#' The widest path between two vertices is the path with the maximum bottleneck width,
#' where the bottleneck width is defined as the minimum edge weight along the path.
#' The functions documented in this manual page all calculate widest paths between vertex pairs.
#'
#' `widest_path_widths()` calculates the widths of pairwise widest paths from
#' a set of vertices (`from`) to another set of vertices (`to`).
#' It uses different algorithms, depending on the `algorithm` argument.
#' The implemented algorithms are Dijkstra's algorithm (\sQuote{`dijkstra`}),
#' which is faster for sparse graphs, and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm
#' (\sQuote{`floyd-warshall`}), which is faster for dense graphs.
#'
#' igraph can choose automatically between algorithms. For automatic algorithm selection,
#' supply \sQuote{`automatic`} as the `algorithm` argument. (This is also the default.)
#'
#' `widest_paths()` calculates a single widest path (i.e. the path
#' itself, not just its width) between the source vertex given in `from`,
#' to the target vertices given in `to`.
#' `widest_paths()` uses a modified Dijkstra's algorithm.
#'
#' @param graph The graph to work on.
#' @param from The source vertex for `widest_paths()`, or a set of source vertices
#'   for `widest_path_widths()`.
#' @param v Numeric vector, the vertices from which the widest paths will be
#'   calculated. This is an alias for `from` in `widest_path_widths()`.
#' @param to Numeric vector, the vertices to which the widest paths will be
#'   calculated. By default it includes all vertices.
#' @param mode Character constant, gives whether the widest paths to or from
#'   the given vertices should be calculated for directed graphs. If `out`
#'   then the widest paths *from* the vertex, if `in` then *to*
#'   it will be considered. If `all`, the default, then the graph is treated
#'   as undirected, i.e. edge directions are not taken into account. This
#'   argument is ignored for undirected graphs.
#' @param weights A numeric vector giving edge weights (interpreted as widths).
#'   If this is `NULL` and the graph has a `weight` edge attribute, then the
#'   attribute is used. Widest path functions require edge weights, so if no
#'   `weight` attribute exists and `weights` is not provided, an error is raised.
#'   In a weighted graph, the width of a path is the minimum weight along the path.
#' @param algorithm Which algorithm to use for the calculation. By default
#'   igraph selects automatically between Dijkstra's algorithm and Floyd-Warshall.
#'   For sparse graphs, Dijkstra is faster; for dense graphs, Floyd-Warshall is faster.
#'   You can override igraph's choice by explicitly giving this parameter.
#' @param output Character scalar, defines how to report the widest paths for `widest_paths()`.
#'   \dQuote{vpath} means that the vertices along the paths are reported,
#'   \dQuote{epath} means that the edges along the paths are reported.
#'   \dQuote{both} means that both forms are returned, in a named list with components
#'   \dQuote{vpath} and \dQuote{epath}.
#' @param predecessors Logical scalar, whether to return the predecessor vertex
#'   for each vertex. The predecessor of vertex `i` in the tree is the
#'   vertex from which vertex `i` was reached. The predecessor of the start
#'   vertex (in the `from` argument) is -1. If the predecessor is -2, it means
#'   that the given vertex was not reached from the source during the search.
#'   Note that the search terminates if all the vertices in `to` are reached.
#' @param inbound.edges Logical scalar, whether to return the inbound edge for
#'   each vertex. The inbound edge of vertex `i` in the tree is the edge via
#'   which vertex `i` was reached. The start vertex and vertices that were
#'   not reached during the search will have -1 in the corresponding entry of
#'   the vector. Note that the search terminates if all the vertices in `to`
#'   are reached.
#'
#' @return For `widest_path_widths()` a numeric matrix with `length(to)`
#'   columns and `length(from)` rows. The widest path width from a vertex to
#'   itself is `Inf`. For unreachable vertices `-Inf` is included.
#'
#'   For `widest_paths()` a named list is returned:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{vpath}{
#'       A list of length `length(to)`. List element `i` contains the vertex ids on
#'       the path from vertex `from` to vertex `to[i]` (or the other way for directed
#'       graphs depending on the `mode` argument).
#'       The vector also contains `from` and `to[i]` as the first and last elements.
#'       If `from` is the same as `to[i]` then it is only included once.
#'       If there is no path between two vertices then a numeric vector of length zero is
#'       returned as the list element.
#'       If this output is not requested in the `output` argument, then it will be `NULL`.
#'     }
#'     \item{epath}{
#'       A list similar to `vpath`, but the vectors contain the edge ids along the widest
#'       paths, instead of the vertex ids. This entry is set to `NULL` if it is not
#'       requested in the `output` argument.
#'     }
#'     \item{predecessors}{
#'       Numeric vector, the predecessor of each vertex, or `NULL` if it was not requested.
#'     }
#'     \item{inbound_edges}{
