#' Minimum spanning tree
#'
#' A *spanning tree* of a connected graph is a connected subgraph with
#' the smallest number of edges that includes all vertices of the graph.
#' A graph will have many spanning trees. Among these, the *minimum spanning
#' tree* will have the smallest sum of edge weights.
#'
#' The *minimum spanning forest* of a disconnected graph is the collection
#' of minimum spanning trees of all of its components.
#'
#' If the graph is not connected a minimum spanning forest is returned.
#'
#' @param graph The graph object to analyze.
#' @param weights Numeric vector giving the weights of the edges in the
#'   graph. The order is determined by the edge ids. This is ignored if the
#'   `unweighted` algorithm is chosen. Edge weights are interpreted as
#'   distances.
#' @param algorithm The algorithm to use for calculation. `unweighted` can
#'   be used for unweighted graphs, and `prim` runs Prim's algorithm for
#'   weighted graphs.  If this is `NULL` then igraph will select the
#'   algorithm automatically: if the graph has an edge attribute called
#'   `weight` or the `weights` argument is not `NULL` then Prim's
#'   algorithm is chosen, otherwise the unweighted algorithm is used.
#' @param \dots Additional arguments, unused.
#' @return A graph object with the minimum spanning forest. To check whether it
#'   is a tree, check that the number of its edges is `vcount(graph)-1`.
#'   The edge and vertex attributes of the original graph are preserved in the
#'   result.
