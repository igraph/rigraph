#' Minimum spanning tree
#' 
#' A subgraph of a connected graph is a \emph{minimum spanning tree} if it is
#' tree, and the sum of its edge weights are the minimal among all tree
#' subgraphs of the graph. A minimum spanning forest of a graph is the graph
#' consisting of the minimum spanning trees of its components.
#' 
#' If the graph is unconnected a minimum spanning forest is returned.
#'
#' @aliases minimum.spanning.tree
#' @param graph The graph object to analyze.
#' @param weights Numeric algorithm giving the weights of the edges in the
#' graph. The order is determined by the edge ids. This is ignored if the
#' \code{unweighted} algorithm is chosen. Edge weights are interpreted as
#' distances.
#' @param algorithm The algorithm to use for calculation. \code{unweighted} can
#' be used for unwieghted graphs, and \code{prim} runs Prim's algorithm for
#' weighted graphs.  If this is \code{NULL} then igraph tries to select the
#' algorithm automatically: if the graph has an edge attribute called
#' \code{weight} or the \code{weights} argument is not \code{NULL} then Prim's
#' algorithm is chosen, otherwise the unwweighted algorithm is performed.
#' @param \dots Additional arguments, unused.
#' @return A graph object with the minimum spanning forest. (To check that it
#' is a tree check that the number of its edges is \code{vcount(graph)-1}.)
#' The edge and vertex attributes of the original graph are preserved in the
#' result.
