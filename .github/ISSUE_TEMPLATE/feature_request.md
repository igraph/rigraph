**What is the feature or improvement you would like to see?**
A concise and mathematically precise description of the requested feature. 

<!-- If the feature request is about an algorithm, consider adding your 
request in the main [igraph repo](https://github.com/igraph/igraph) instead.
In most cases the R interface simply provides access to the functionality of 
the igraph library, so new algorithms should be added there in general. -->

**Use cases for the feature**
Explain when and for what purpose the feature would be useful.

**References**
List any relevant references (papers or books describing relevant algorithms).
