## Updating the C sources

1. Clean the `src/` directory:

    ```sh
    make -f Makefile-cigraph clean
    ```

2. Update the `src/` directory:

    ```sh
    make -f Makefile-cigraph
    ```

    Note that this may change files generated by `flex` and `bison`, and configure scripts, depending on the version of those tools.
    For stability, the `Makefile` uses Docker with pinned versions of those tools.

3. Review the changes, especially in `src/` and `configure`:

    ```sh
    git diff src/ configure
    ```

4. Commit and push
