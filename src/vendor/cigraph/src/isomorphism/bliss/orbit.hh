/**
 * \brief A class for representing orbit information.
 *
 * Given a set {0,...,N-1} of N elements, represent equivalence
 * classes (that is, unordered partitions) of the elements.
 * Supports only equivalence class merging, not splitting.
 * Merging two classes requires time O(k), where k is the number of
 * the elements in the smaller of the merged classes.
 * Getting the smallest representative in a class
 * (and thus testing whether two elements belong to the same class)
 * is a constant time operation.
