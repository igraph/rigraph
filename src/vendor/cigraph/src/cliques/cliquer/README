Cliquer - routines for clique searching
---------------------------------------


Cliquer is a set of C routines for finding cliques in an arbitrary
weighted graph. It uses an exact branch-and-bound algorithm recently
developed by Patric Ostergard. It is designed with the aim of being
efficient while still being flexible and easy to use.

Cliquer was developed on Linux, and it should compile without
modification on most modern UNIX systems. Other operating systems may
require minor changes to the source code.

Features:

  * support for both weighted and unweighted graphs (faster routines
    for unweighted graphs)
  * search for maximum clique / maximum-weight clique
  * search for clique with size / weight within a given range
  * restrict search to maximal cliques
  * store found cliques in memory
  * call a user-defined function for every clique found
  * Cliquer is re-entrant, so you can use the clique-searching
    functions from within the callback function
