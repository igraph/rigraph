# igraph 1.5.0

## Breaking changes

The internal format of graph objects has changed in a mostly backward-compatible way, to prepare for upgrading the C core to 0.10. Details are described at <https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/wiki/The-igraph-object-format>. Accessing graph objects that have been created with an older igraph version give a clean error message with instructions (#832). The new format cannot be read by igraph 1.4.3 or older, the following error is raised when trying to do so:

```
This graph was created by an old(er) igraph version.
  Call upgrade_graph() on it to use with the current igraph version
  For now we convert it on the fly...
Error in is_directed(object) : 
  REAL() can only be applied to a 'numeric', not a 'NULL'
```

The only supported remedy is to upgrade the igraph package to version 1.5.0 or later.

`graph_version()` now returns an integer scalar (#832, #847), `4` as of igraph 1.5.0 (#835).

## Features

- Vertex and edge sequences are converted to numeric vectors when used in attributes (#808).

- New `largest_component()` returns the largest connected component (#786, @ngmaclaren).

## Bug fixes

- Fix error message in `make_graph()` when `simplify = ...` is used with a non-formula (#834).

## Testing

- Add more tests for `graph_from_literal()` (#826).

- Reenable serialization test and tests for `dyad_census()`, stabilize tests (#809, #822, #823).

## Documentation

- The documentation for the R package is now hosted at <https://r.igraph.org/> (#780).

- Update `vignette("installation-troubleshooting")`.

- Fix use of deprecated functions in examples, e.g., replace `gsize()` by `ecount()` (#827).

- Fix typos in `?eigen_centrality` docs (@JJ).

- Update CONTRIBUTING.md and ORCID information (#791, #774).

- Add DOI to CITATION (#773).

## Internal

- Add data for old igraph versions as constructed objects, and tests (#838).

- Ensure we're always using named indexes to access the internal data structure (#784).

- Prepare migration to igraph/C 0.10 (#781).

- Update generated interface (#765).


# igraph 1.4.3

## Internal

- Fix tests for dev waldo (#779, @hadley).

- Fix linking on Windows: gfortran needs quadmath. (#778).

## Documentation

- Mention limitation of Pajek reader (#776).


# igraph 1.4.2

## Breaking changes

- Remove `igraph.eigen.default()` and `eigen_defaults`, introduce internal `eigen_defaults()` as a function (#741).

- Remove broken `nexus*()` functions (#705), and `srand()` (#701).


## C core

- Update C core.

- ARPACK-based calculations are now interruptible.

- `shortest_paths()` and `all_shortest_paths()` no longer crash when an invalid `from` vertex is passed and weights are being used.

See [diff](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/compare/87c70998344a39b44218f7af903bf62b8bbf3e71...98304787bc811bf709be5aeddea7b570c370988e) for details.


## Printing

- Use true vertex names for printing vertex sets. If a vertex set captures a relationship between vertices (e.g., the `father` component of `bfs()`), the vertex set is printed as a named vector (#754).

- Suggest restarting R session after fatal error (#745).


## Bug fixes

- `as_long_data_frame()` now correctly processes vertex attributes and works with graphs without vertex attributes (#748).

- `as.hclust(hrg.fit(g))` works again (#721).


## Documentation

- The documentation is now available at <https://igraph.org/> (#743).

- Reorganize function reference (#662).

- Replace `graph()` with `make_graph()` in examples (#738).

- Avoid longjmp for error handling and interrupts (#751).

- `as.hclust.igraphHRG` uses `.Call()` interface (#727).


# igraph 1.4.1

## Bug fixes

- Fix errors when printing long vertex names (#677, @ahmohamed).

- Fix regression that broke builds on some systems (e.g., GCC version 5 or earlier), introduced in igraph 1.4.0 (#670, #671).

- `fit_hrg()` does not crash any more when called with a graph that has less than three vertices.

## Documentation

- Various improvements (#663, @maelle; #667).

## Internal

- Fix warning about `yyget_leng()` returning wrong type when using LTO (#676).

- Don't mention C++11 or C++17 for best compatibility with both newest R and older compilers, while still requesting a C++ compiler for linking.

- Don't ignore `build/` when building the package because the vignette index is built there.

- Skip plot test entirely on R-devel.

- Avoid submodules for building igraph (#674).

- Makevars cleanup (#671).

- Add Zenodo configuration file.


# igraph 1.4.0

## Breaking changes

 - Breaking change: Allow change of attribute type when setting attribute for all vertices or edges; only attributes of length 1 or the length of the target set allowed (#633).


## Added

 - `tkplot()` gained a `palette` argument and it is now using the same palette as `plot()` by default, for sake of consistency.
 - `plot.igraph()` gained a `loop.size` argument that can be used to scale the common radius of the loop edges.

## Fixed

 - The default maximum number of iterations for ARPACK has been increased to 3000 to match that of the igraph C core.
 - Rare convergence problems have been corrected in `cluster_leading_eigen()`.
 - All ARPACK-based functions now respect random seeds set in R when generating a random starting vector.
 - `igraph_version()` returned an invalid value in 1.3.4, this is now corrected.
 - The value of `par(xpd=...)` is now restored after plotting a graph.
 - Fixed a bug in `as.dendrogram.communities()` for large dendrograms, thanks
   to @pkharchenko (see PR #292).
 - Fixed two bugs in `graph_from_incidence_matrix()` that prevented the creation of directed graphs with `mode="all"` from dense or sparse matrices.
 - `dfs()` accidentally returned zero-based root vertex indices in the result object; this is now fixed and the indices are now 1-based.
 - `as_graphnel()` does not duplicate loop edges any more.
 - `as_graphnel()` now checks that the input graph has no multi-edges. Multi-edges are not supported by the graphNEL class.
 - `convex_hull()` now returns the vertices of the convex hull with 1-based indexing.
 - Some `rgl.*()` function calls in the codebase were replaced with equivalent `*3d()` function calls in preparation for upcoming deprecations in `rgl` (see PR #619)
 - `plot.igraph()` does not use the `frame=...` partial argument any more when calling `plot.default()`. The default `NULL` value of `frame.plot` is now also handled correctly.
 - `hub_score()` and `authority_score()` considered self-loops only once on the diagonal of the adjacency matrix of undirected graphs, thus the result was not identical to that obtained by `eigen_centrality()` on loopy undirected graphs. This is now corrected.
 - `distances()` no longer ignores the `mode` parameter when `algorithm='johnson'`.

## Deprecated

 - `automorphisms()` was renamed to `count_automorphisms()`; the old name is still available, but it is deprecated.

## Other

 - Documentation improvements.
 - The Github repository was now moved to a single-branch setup where the package can be built from the `main` branch directly.
 - Added igraph extended tutorial as an R vignette (#587).
 - igraph now has a homepage based on `pkgdown` thanks to @maelle (see #645). This will eventually become the official homepage.

# igraph 1.3.5

Added:

- `mark.groups=...` argument of `plot.igraph()` now accepts `communities`
  objects

Fixed:

- Negative degree exponents are not allowed any more in `sample_pa()` and
  `sample_aging_pa()`.

- Package updated to be compatible with Matrix 1.5.

Other:

 - Documentation improvements and fixes.

# igraph 1.3.4

Added:

- `sample_asym_pref()` now returns the generated types of the vertices in the
  vertex attributes named `outtype` and `intype`.

Fixed:

- `layout_nicely()` does not recurse infinitely any more if it is assigned to
  the `layout` attribute of a graph

- `layout_nicely()` now ignores edge weights when there are non-positive
  edge weights. This is needed because igraph 1.3.3 started validating edge
  weights in `layout_with_fr()` and `layout_with_drl()`, resulting in
  errors when `layout_nicely()` was used on weighted graphs with negative
  weights. Since `layout_nicely()` is the default layout algorithm for
  `plot()`, most users were not even aware that they were using the FR or
  DrL layouts behind the scenes. Now the policy is that `layout_nicely()`
  attempts to get the job done without errors if possible, even if that means
  that edge weights must be ignored. A warning is printed if this is the case.

# igraph 1.3.3

Added:

- `reverse_edges()` reverses specific or all edges in a graph.

- Single-bracket indexing of `V()` and `E()` resolves attribute names in the
  indexing expressions by default (for instance, `E(g)[weight > x]` matches
  edges with a weight larger than a threshold). This can be problematic if the
  attribute masks one of the variables in the local evaluation context.
  We now have a pronoun called `.env` (similarly to `rlang::.env`) that
  allows you to force attribute name lookup to the calling environment. For
  sake of completeness, we also provide `.data` (similarly to `rlang::.data`)
  to force attribute name lookup to the vertex / edge attributes only. These
  pronouns are automatically injected into the environment where the indexing
  expression is evaluated.

Deprecated:

- Names of functions that can be used inside a `V()` or `E()` indexing start
  with a dot since igraph 1.1.1; however, the old dotless names did not print
  a deprecation warning so this may have gone unnoticed for years. We are
  introducting a deprecation warning for `nei()`, `innei()`, `outnei()`,
  `inc()`, `from()` and `to()` inside single-bracket indexing of vertex and
  edge sequences and will remove the old variants soon.

# igraph 1.3.2

The C core is updated to 0.9.9, fixing a range of bugs.

Fixed:

- The length of size-zero `communities` objects is now reported correctly.
- `layout_with_kk()` would fail to produce reasonable results with the default initial
  coordinates. This has been corrected, however, this function no longer produces
  precisely the same output for a given graph as before. To restore the previous
  behaviour, use `layout_with_kk(g, coord=layout_in_circle(g))` in 2D or
  `layout_with_kk(g, dim=3, coord=layout_on_sphere(g))` in 3D.
- Indexing an `igraph.vs` object with `v[x, na_ok=T]` now correctly handles the
  `na_ok` argument in all cases; previous versions ignored it when `x` was
  a single number.

Other:

 - Documentation improvements and fixes.

# igraph 1.3.1

Fixed:

- `graph_from_adjacency_matrix()` now works with sparse matrices even if the
  cell values in the sparse matrix are unspecified.
- Fixed crash in `cluster_walktrap()` when `modularity=FALSE` and `membership=FALSE`.
- `cluster_walktrap()` no longer accepts invalid weight vectors.
- `cluster_walktrap()` no longer returns a modularity vector of invalid length for
  disconnected graphs. This also fixes some rare failures of this function on
  weighted disconnected graphs.
- `edge_attr()` does not ignore its `index=...` argument any more.
- `automorphisms()`, `automorphism_group()` and `canonical_permutation()` now
  allow all possible values supported by the C core in the `sh` argument.
  Earlier versions supported only `"fm"`.
- The `vertex.frame.width` plotting parameter now allows zero and negative
  values; these will simply remove the outline of the corresponding vertex.
- The documentation of the `sh` argument of the BLISS isomorphism algorithm in
  `isomorphic()` was fixed; earlier versions incorrectly referred to `sh1` and
  `sh2`.
- `dominator_tree()` now conforms to its documentation with respect to the
  `dom` component of the result: it contains the indices of the dominator
  vertices for each vertex and `-1` for the root of the dominator tree.
- Mentions of the `"power"` algorithm of `page_rank()` have been removed from
  the documentation, as this method is no longer available.
- Several other documentation fixes to bring the docs up to date with new behaviours
  in igraph 1.3.

# igraph 1.3.0

The C core is updated to 0.9.7, fixing a range of bugs and introducing a number
of new functions.

Added:

- `has_eulerian_path()` and `has_eulerian_cycle()` decides whether there is an
  Eulerian path or cycle in the graph.
- `eulerian_path()` and `eulerian_cycle()` returns the edges and vertices in an
  Eulerian path or cycle in the graph.
- `any_loop()` checks whether a graph contains at least one loop edge.
- `is_tree()` checks whether a graph is a tree and also finds a possible root
- `to_prufer()` converts a tree graph into its Prufer sequence
- `make_from_prufer()` creates a tree graph from its Prufer sequence
- `sample_tree()` to sample labelled trees uniformly at random
- `sample_spanning_tree()` to sample spanning trees of an undirected graph
  uniformly at random
- `automorphisms()` and `canonical_permutation()` now supports vertex colors
- `random_edge_walk()` to record the edges traversed during a random walk
- `harmonic_centrality()` calculates the harmonic centrality of vertices,
  optionally with a cutoff on path lengths
- `mean_distance()` now supports edge weights and it can also return the number
  of unconnected vertex pairs when `details=TRUE` is passed as an argument
- `greedy_vertex_coloring()` finds vertex colorings based on a simple greedy
  algorithm.
- `bridges()` finds the bridges (cut-edges) of a graph
- The frame width of circle, rectangle and square vertex shapes can now be
  adjusted on plots with the `frame.width` vertex attribute or the
  `vertex.frame.width` keyword argument, thanks to @simoncarrignon .
  See PR #500 for more details.
- `automorphism_group()` returns a possible (not necessarily minimal)
  generating set of the automorphism group of a graph.
- `global_efficiency()` calculates the global efficiency of the graph.
- `local_efficiency()` calculates the local efficiency of each vertex in a graph.
- `average_local_efficiency()` calculates the average local efficiency across
  the set of vertices in a graph.
- `rewire(each_edge(...))` now supports rewiring only one endpoint of each edge.
- `realize_degseq()` generates graphs from degree sequences in a deterministic
  manner. It is also available as `make_(degseq(..., deterministic=TRUE))`.
- `clique_size_counts()` counts cliques of different sizes without storing them all.
- `feedback_arc_set()` finds a minimum-weight feedback arc set in a graph, either
  with an exact integer programming algorithm or with a linear-time approximation.
- `make_bipartite_graph()` now handles vertices with names.
- `shortest_paths()` now supports graphs with negative edge weights.
- `min_cut()` now supports s-t mincuts even if `value.only=FALSE`.
- `as.matrix()` now supports converting an igraph graph to an adjacency or edge
  list matrix representation. See `as.matrix.igraph()` for more details. This
  function was migrated from `intergraph`; thanks to Michal Bojanowski.

Fixed:

- `is_connected()` now returns FALSE for the null graph
- Calling `length()` on a graph now returns the number of vertices to make it
  consistent with indexing the graph with `[[`.
- `diameter()` now corrently returns infinity for disconnected graphs when
  `unconnected=FALSE`. Previous versions returned the number of vertices plus
  one, which was clearly invalid for weighted graphs.
- `mean_distance()` now correctly treats the path length between disconnected
  vertices as infinite when `unconnected=FALSE`. Previous versions used the
  number of vertices plus one, adding a bias towards this number, even if the
  graph was weighted and the number of vertices plus one was not a path length
  that could safely have been considered as being longer than any "valid" path.
- `layout_with_sugiyama()` now handles the case of exactly one extra virtual
  node correctly; fixes #85
- `bfs()` and `dfs()` callback functions now correctly receive 1-based vertex
  indices and ranks; it used to be zero-based in earlier versions
- Accidentally returning a non-logical value from a `bfs()` or `dfs()` callback
  does not crash R any more
- Calling `print()` on a graph with a small `max.lines` value (smaller than the
  number of lines needed to print the attribute list and the header) does not
  raise an error any more; fixes #179
- `as_adjacency_matrix(edges=TRUE, sparse=TRUE)` now consistently returns the
  last edge ID for each cell in the matrix instead of summing them.
- Using the `+` and `-` operators with a `path()` object consisting of two
  vertices is now handled correctly; fixes #355
- `topo_sort()` now throws an error if the input graph is not acyclic instead
  of returning an incorrect partial ordering.
- Weighted transitivity calculations (i.e. `transitivity(mode="barrat")` now
  throw an error for multigraphs; the implementation does not work correctly
  for multigraphs and earlier versions did not warn about this.

Changed:

- The `neimode` argument of `bfs()` and `dfs()` was renamed to `mode` for sake
  of consistency with other functions. The old argument name is deprecated and
  will be removed in 1.4.0.
- `bfs()` and `dfs()` callback functions now correctly receive 1-based vertex
  indices and ranks; it used to be zero-based in earlier versions. (This is
  actually a bugfix so it's also mentioned in the "Fixed" section).
- `closeness()`, `betweenness()` and `edge_betweenness()` now all take a
  `cutoff` argument on their own. `estimate_closeness()`, `estimate_betweenness()`
  and `estimate_edge_betweenness()` became aliases, with identical signature.
  They are _not_ deprecated but their implementation might change in future
  versions to provide proper estimation schemes instead of a simple cutoff-based
  approximation. If you explicitly need cutoffs and you want your results to be
  reproducible with future versions, use `closeness()`, `betweenness()` and
  `edge_betweenness()` in your code with a `cutoff` argument.
- `closeness()` now only considers _reachable_ vertices during the calculation;
  in other words, closeness centrality is now calculated on a per-component
  basis for disconnected graphs. Earlier versions considered _all_ vertices.

Deprecated:

- Using `cutoff=0` for `closeness()`, `betweenness()` and `edge_betweenness()`
  is deprecated; if you want exact scores, use a negative cutoff. `cutoff=0`
  will be interpreted literally from igraph 1.4.0.
- `centr_degree_tmax()` now prints a warning when it is invoked without an
  explicit `loops` argument. `loops` will be mandatory from igraph 1.4.0.
- The `nexus_list()`, `nexus_info()`, `nexus_get()` and `nexus_search()`
  functions now return an error informing the user that the Nexus graph
  repository has been taken offline (actually, several years ago). These
  functions will be removed in 1.4.0.
- The `edges` argument of `as_adjacency_matrix()` is deprecated; it will be
  removed in igraph 1.4.0.

Removed:

- The deprecated `page_rank_old()` function and the deprecated `power` method of
  `page_rank()` were removed.

# igraph 1.2.11

Dec 27, 2021

No user visible changes.

# igraph 1.2.10

Dec 14, 2021

Fixed:

- The macOS versions of `igraph` were accidentally built without GraphML
  support on CRAN; this should now be fixed.

# igraph 1.2.9

No user visible changes.

# igraph 1.2.8

Oct 26, 2021

No user visible changes.

# igraph 1.2.7

Oct 15, 2021

The C core is updated to 0.8.5, fixing a range of bugs and introducing a number of new functions.

Added:

- cluster_leiden added (#399).
- cluster_fluid_communities added (#454)

Fixed:

- `make_lattice()` correctly rounds `length` to the nearest integer while
  printing a warning (#115).
- `make_empty_graph(NULL)` now prints an error instead of producing an
  invalid graph (#404).
- `make_graph(c())` now produces an empty graph instead of printing a
  misleading error message (#431).
- Printing a graph where some edges have NA as the names of both endpoints
  does not produce a misleading error message any more (#410).
- The `types` argument of functions related to bipartite graphs now prints
  a warning when the types are coerced to booleans (#476).
- Betweenness normalisation no longer overflows (#442).
- `layout_with_sugiyama()` returns a layout of type matrix even if there is
  only one vertex in the graph (#408).
- Plotting a null graph (i.e. a graph with no vertices) does not throw an error
  any more (#387).

Deprecated:

- The `membership` argument of `modularity.matrix()` is now deprecated as the
  function never needed it anyway.
- `modularity()` now prints a warning when it is applied on a directed graph
  because the implementation in igraph's C core does not support directed
  graphs as of version 0.8.5. The warning will be turned into an error in
  the next minor (1.3.0) version of the R interface; the error will be removed
  later when the C core is updated to a version that supports modularity for
  directed networks.
- `transitivity()` now prints a warning when its local variant (`type="local"`)
  is called on a directed graph or a graph with multiple edges beecause the
  implementation in the C core of igraph does not work reliably in these cases
  as of version 0.8.5. The warning will be turned into an error in the next
  minor (1.3.0) version of the R interface; the error will be removed later
  when the C core is updated to a version that supports transitivity for
  networks with multiple edges.

Misc:

- Documentation improvements.

# igraph 1.2.1

- The GLPK library is optional, if it is not available, then the
  `cluster_optimal()` function does not work. Unfortunately we cannot
  bundle the GLPK library into igraph on CRAN any more, because CRAN
  maintainers forbid the pragmas in its source code.
- Removed the NMF package dependency, and related functions.
- Fix compilation without libxml2

# igraph 1.1.2

Jul 20, 2017

- Fix compilation on Solaris


# igraph 1.1.1

Jul 13, 2017

- Graph id is printed in the header, and a `graph_id` function was added
- Fix `edge_attr` for some index values
- Fix a `bfs()` bug, `restricted` argument was zero-based
- `match_vertices` is exported now
- `%>%` is re-exported in a better way, to avoid interference with other
  packages
- `ego_` functions default to `order = 1` now
- New function `igraph_with_opt` to run code with temporary igraph
  options settings
- Fix broken `sample_asym_pref` function
- Fix `curve_multiple` to avoid warnings for graphs with self-loops.
- The `NMF` package is only suggested now, it is not a hard
  dependency
- Fix gen_uid.c _SVID_SOURCE issues
- Avoid drawing straight lines as Bezier curves
- Use the `pkgconfig` package for options. This allows setting options
  on a per-package basis. E.g. a package using igraph can set `return.vs.es`
  to `FALSE` in its `.onLoad()` function, and then igraph will return
  plain numeric vectors instead of vertex/edge sequences
  *if called from this package*.
- `igraph_options()` returns the *old* values of the updated options,
  this is actually useful, returning the new values was not.
- `with_igraph_opt()` function to temporarily change values of
  igraph options.
- `get.edge()` is deprecated, use `ends()` instead. (This was already the case
  for igraph 1.0.0, but we forgot to add a NEWS point for it.)
- Do not redefine `.Call()`, to make native calls faster.
- Speed up special cases of indexing vertex sequences.
- Removed an `anyNA()` call, to be compatible with older R versions.
- Fixed a fast-greedy community finding bug,
  https://github.com/igraph/igraph/issues/836
- Fixed `head_of()` and `tail_of()`, they were mixed up.
- Plot: make `label.dist` independent of label lengths, fixes #63.
- Plot: no error for unknown graphical parameters.
- Import functions from base packages, to eliminate
  `R CMD check` `NOTE`s.
- Re-add support for edge weights in Fruchterman-Reingold layout
- Check membership vector in `modularity()`.
- Rename `str.igraph()` to `print_all()`.
- Use the igraph version in exported graphs, instead of @VERSION@ #75.
- Functions that can be used inside a `V()` or `E()` indexing
  now begin with a dot. Old names are deprecated.
  New names: `.nei()`, `.innei()`, `.outnei()`, `.inc()`, `.from()`,
  `.to()`. #22
- Fix packages that convert graphs to graph::graphNEL: they
  don't need to attach 'graph' manually any more.
- Fix a bugs in `layout_with_dh`, `layout_with_gem` and
  `layout_with_sugiyama`. They crashed in some cases.

# igraph 1.0.1

June 26, 2015

Some minor updates:

- Documentation fixes.
- Do not require a C++-11 compiler any more.
- Fedora, Solaris and Windows compilation fixes.

# igraph 1.0.0

June 21, 2015

## Release notes

This is a new major version of igraph, and then why not call
it 1.0.0. This does not mean that it is ready, it'll never be
ready.

The biggest changes in the release are
- the new function names. Most functions were renamed to
  make them more consistent and readable. (Relax, old names
  can still be used, no need to update any code.)
- Better operations for vertex and edge sequences. Most functions
  return proper vertex/edge sequences instead of numeric ids.
- The versatile `make_()` and `make_graph()` functions to
  create graphs.

## Major changes

- Many functions were renamed. Old names are not documented,
  but can still be used.
- A generic `make_graph()` function to create graphs.
- A generic `layout_()` (not the underscore!) function
  to create graph layouts, see also `add_layout_()`.
- The igraph data type has changed. You need to call
  `upgrade_graph()` on graphs created with previous igraph
  versions.
- Vertex and edge sequence operations: union, intersection, etc.
- Vertex and edge sequences can only be used with the graphs they
  belong to. This is now strictly checked.
- Most functions that return a (sub)set of vertices
  or edges return vertex or edge sequences instead.
- Vertex and edge sequences have a `[[` operator now,
  for easy viewing of vertex/edge metadata.
- Vertex and edge sequences are implemented as weak references.
  See also the `as_ids()` function to convert them to simple ids.
- Vertex order can be specified for the circle layout now.
- Davidson-Harel layout algorithm `layout_with_dh()`.
- GEM layout algorithm `layout_with_gem()`.
- Neighborhood functions have a `mindist` parameter for the
  smallest distance to consider.
- `all_simple_paths()` function to list all simple paths in a graph.
- `triangles()` lists all triangles in a graph.
- Fruchterman-Reingold and Kamada-Kawai layout algorithms
  rewritten from scratch. They are much faster and follow the
  original publications closely.
- Nicer printing of graphs, vertex and edge sequences.
- `local_scan()` function calculates scan statistics.
- Embeddings: `embed_adjacency_matrix()` and `embed_laplacian_matrix()`.
- Product operator: `*`, the same graph multiple times. Can be also
  used as `rep()`.
- Better default colors, color palettes for vertices.
- Random walk on a graph: `random_walk()`
- `adjacent_vertices()` and `incident_edges()` functions,
  they are vectorized, as opposed to `neighhors()` and `incident()`.
- Convert a graph to a _long_ data frame with `as_long_data_frame()`.

## Bug fixes

Too many to list. Please try if your issue was fixed and (re-)report
it if not. Thanks!

  fixes issue #571.

# igraph 0.7.0

February 4, 2014

## Release Notes

There are a bunch of new features in the library itself, and
other important changes in the life of the project. Thanks everyone
for sending code and reporting bugs!

### igraph @ github

igraph's development has moved from Launchpad to github.
This has actually happened several month ago, but never
announced officially. The place for reporting bugs is
at https://github.com/igraph/igraph/issues.

### New homepage

igraph's homepage is now hosted at http://igraph.org, and it is
brand new. We wanted to make it easier to use and modern.

### Better nightly downloads

You can download nightly builds from igraph at
http://igraph.org/nightly. Source and binary R packages (for windows
and OSX), are all built.

- Fixed a bug that caused a side effect in set.vertex.attributes(),
  set.edge.attributes() and set.graph.attributes() (#533).
- Fixed a bug in degree.distribution() and cluster.distribution()
  (#257).

# igraph 0.6.5-2

Released May 16, 2013

Worked two CRAN check problems, and a gfortran bug (string bound
checking does not work if code is called from C and without string
length arguments at the "right" place).

Otherwise identical to 0.6.5-1.

# igraph 0.6.5-1

Released February 27, 2013

Fixing an annoying bug, that broke two other packages on CRAN:

- Setting graph attributes failed sometimes, if the attributes were
  lists or other complex objects.

# igraph 0.6.5

Released February 24, 2013

This is a minor release, to fix some very annoying bugs in 0.6.4:

- igraph should now work well with older R versions.
- Eliminate gap between vertex and edge when plotting an edge without an arrow.
  Fixes #1118448.
- Fixed an out-of-bounds array indexing error in the DrL layout, that
  potentially caused crashes.
- Fixed a crash in weighted betweenness calculation.
- Plotting: fixed a bug that caused misplaced arrows at rectangle
  vertex shapes.

# igraph 0.6.4

Released February 2, 2013

The version number is not a mistake, we jump to 0.6.4 from 0.6,
for technical reasons. This version was actually never really
released, but some R packages of this version were uploaded to
CRAN, so we include this version in this NEW file.

## New features and bug fixes

- Added a vertex shape API for defining new vertex shapes, and also
  a couple of new vertex shapes.
- Added the get.data.frame() function, opposite of graph.data.frame().

# igraph 0.6

Released June 11, 2012

See also the release notes at
http://igraph.sf.net/relnotes-0.6.html

## R: Major new features

- Vertices and edges are numbered from 1 instead of 0.
  Note that this makes most of the old R igraph code incompatible
  with igraph 0.6. If you want to use your old code, please use
  the igraph0 package. See more at http://igraph.sf.net/relnotes-0.6.html.
- The '[' and '[[' operators can now be used on igraph graphs,
  for '[' the graph behaves as an adjacency matrix, for '[[' is
  is treated as an adjacency list. It is also much simpler to
  manipulate the graph structure, i.e. add/remove edges and vertices,
  with some new operators. See more at ?graph.structure.
- In all functions that take a vector or list of vertices or edges,
  vertex/edge names can be given instead of the numeric ids.
- New package 'igraphdata', contains a number of data sets that can
  be used directly in igraph.
- Igraph now supports loading graphs from the Nexus online data
  repository, see nexus.get(), nexus.info(), nexus.list() and
  nexus.search().
- All the community structure finding algorithm return a 'communities'
  object now, which has a bunch of useful operations, see
  ?communities for details.
- Vertex and edge attributes are handled much better now. They
  are kept whenever possible, and can be combined via a flexible API.
  See ?attribute.combination.
- R now prints igraph graphs to the screen in a more structured and
  informative way. The output of summary() was also updated
  accordingly.

## R: Other new features

- It is possible to mark vertex groups on plots, via
  shading. Communities and cohesive blocks are plotted using this by
  default.
- Some igraph demos are now available, see a list via
  'demo(package="igraph")'.
- igraph now tries to select the optimal layout algorithm, when
  plotting a graph.
- Added a simple console, using Tcl/Tk. It contains a text area
  for status messages and also a status bar. See igraph.console().
- Reimplemented igraph options support, see igraph.options() and
  getIgraphOpt().
- Igraph functions can now print status messages.

## R: New or updated functions

### Community detection

- The multi-level modularity optimization community structure detection
  algorithm by Blondel et al. was added, see multilevel.community().

  optimal.community().
- Hierarchical random graphs and community finding, porting the code
  from Aaron Clauset. See hrg.game(), hrg.fit(), etc.

- Eigenvector centrality calculation, evcent() now works for
  directed graphs.
- Betweenness calculation can now use arbitrarily large integers,
  this is required for some lattice-like graphs to avoid overflow.

### Input/output and file formats

- Support the DL file format in graph.read(). See
  http://www.analytictech.com/networks/dataentry.htm.
- Support writing the LEDA file format in write.graph().

### Plotting and layouts

- Star layout: layout.star().
- Layout based on multidimensional scaling, layout.mds().
- New layouts layout.grid() and layout.grid.3d().
- Sugiyama layout algorithm for layered directed acyclic graphs,
  layout.sugiyama().

### Graph generators

- New graph generators: static.fitness.game(), static.power.law.game().
- barabasi.game() was rewritten and it supports three algorithms now,
  the default algorithm does not generate multiple or loop edges.
  The graph generation process can now start from a supplied graph.

  now create graphs without loop edges.

### Others

  functions (graph.isomorphic.vf2(), graph.count.isomorphisms.vf2(),
  graph.get.isomorphisms.vf2(), graph.subisomorphic.vf2(),
  graph.count.subisomorphisms.vf2(), graph.get.subisomorphisms.vf2()).
- Assortativity coefficient, assortativity(), assortativity.nominal()
  and assortativity.degree().
- Vertex operators that work by vertex names:
  graph.intersection.by.name(), graph.union.by.name(),
  graph.difference.by.name(). Thanks to Magnus Torfason for
  contributing his code!
- Function to calculate a non-induced subgraph: subgraph.edges().
- More comprehensive maximum flow and minimum cut calculation,
  see functions graph.maxflow(), graph.mincut(), stCuts(), stMincuts().

- has.multiple() to decide whether a graph has multiple edges.
- Added a function to calculate a diversity score for the vertices,
  graph.diversity().
