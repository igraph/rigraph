# Sample from a random graph model

Generic function for sampling from network models.

## Usage

``` r
sample_(...)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Parameters, see details below.

## Details

`sample_()` is a generic function for creating graphs. For every graph
constructor in igraph that has a `sample_` prefix, there is a
corresponding function without the prefix: e.g. for
[`sample_pa()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/sample_pa.md) there is
also [`pa()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/sample_pa.md), etc.

The same is true for the deterministic graph samplers, i.e. for each
constructor with a `make_` prefix, there is a corresponding function
without that prefix.

These shorter forms can be used together with `sample_()`. The advantage
of this form is that the user can specify constructor modifiers which
work with all constructors. E.g. the
[`with_vertex_()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/with_vertex_.md)
modifier adds vertex attributes to the newly created graphs.

See the examples and the various constructor modifiers below.
