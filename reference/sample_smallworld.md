# The Watts-Strogatz small-world model

This function generates networks with the small-world property based on
a variant of the Watts-Strogatz model. The network is obtained by first
creating a periodic undirected lattice, then rewiring both endpoints of
each edge with probability `p`, while avoiding the creation of
multi-edges.

## Usage

``` r
sample_smallworld(dim, size, nei, p, loops = FALSE, multiple = FALSE)

smallworld(...)
```

## Arguments

- dim:

  Integer constant, the dimension of the starting lattice.

- size:

  Integer constant, the size of the lattice along each dimension.

- nei:

  Integer constant, the neighborhood within which the vertices of the
  lattice will be connected.

- p:

  Real constant between zero and one, the rewiring probability.

- loops:

  Logical scalar, whether loops edges are allowed in the generated
  graph.

- multiple:

  Logical scalar, whether multiple edges are allowed int the generated
  graph.

- ...:

  Passed to `sample_smallworld()`.

## Value

A graph object.

## Details

Note that this function might create graphs with loops and/or multiple
edges. You can use
[`simplify()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/simplify.md) to get rid of
these.

This process differs from the original model of Watts and Strogatz (see
reference) in that it rewires **both** endpoints of edges. Thus in the
limit of `p=1`, we obtain a G(n,m) random graph with the same number of
vertices and edges as the original lattice. In comparison, the original
Watts-Strogatz model only rewires a single endpoint of each edge, thus
the network does not become fully random even for `p=1`. For appropriate
choices of `p`, both models exhibit the property of simultaneously
having short path lengths and high clustering.
