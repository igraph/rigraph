# Count the number of isomorphic mappings between two graphs

Count the number of isomorphic mappings between two graphs

## Usage

``` r
count_isomorphisms(graph1, graph2, method = "vf2", ...)
```

## Arguments

- graph1:

  The first graph.

- graph2:

  The second graph.

- method:

  Currently only ‘vf2’ is supported, see
  [`isomorphic()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/isomorphic.md) for
  details about it and extra arguments.

- ...:

  Passed to the individual methods.

## Value

Number of isomorphic mappings between the two graphs.

## Examples

``` r
# colored graph isomorphism
g1 <- make_ring(10)
g2 <- make_ring(10)
isomorphic(g1, g2)
#> [1] TRUE

V(g1)$color <- rep(1:2, length = vcount(g1))
V(g2)$color <- rep(2:1, length = vcount(g2))
# consider colors by default
count_isomorphisms(g1, g2)
#> [1] 10
# ignore colors
count_isomorphisms(g1, g2,
  vertex.color1 = NULL,
  vertex.color2 = NULL
)
#> [1] 20
```
