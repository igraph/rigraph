# Generate random graphs according to the Erdős-Rényi model

**\[deprecated\]**

Since igraph version 0.8.0, both `erdos.renyi.game()` and
`random.graph.game()` are deprecated, and
[`sample_gnp()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/sample_gnp.md) and
[`sample_gnm()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/sample_gnm.md) should be
used instead. See these for more details.

`random.graph.game()` is an (also deprecated) alias to this function.

## Usage

``` r
erdos.renyi.game(
  n,
  p.or.m,
  type = c("gnp", "gnm"),
  directed = FALSE,
  loops = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  The number of vertices in the graph.

- p.or.m:

  Either the probability for drawing an edge between two arbitrary
  vertices (\\G(n,p)\\ graph), or the number of edges in the graph (for
  \\G(n,m)\\ graphs).

- type:

  The type of the random graph to create, either
  [`gnp()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/sample_gnp.md) (\\G(n,p)\\
  graph) or [`gnm()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/sample_gnm.md)
  (\\G(n,m)\\ graph).

- directed:

  Logical, whether the graph will be directed, defaults to `FALSE`.

- loops:

  Logical, whether to add loop edges, defaults to `FALSE`.

## Value

A graph object.
