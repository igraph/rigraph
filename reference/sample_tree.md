# Sample trees randomly and uniformly

`sample_tree()` generates a random with a given number of nodes uniform
at random from the set of labelled trees.

## Usage

``` r
sample_tree(n, directed = FALSE, method = c("lerw", "prufer"))
```

## Arguments

- n:

  The number of nodes in the tree

- directed:

  Whether to create a directed tree. The edges of the tree are oriented
  away from the root.

- method:

  The algorithm to use to generate the tree. ‘prufer’ samples Prüfer
  sequences uniformly and then converts the sampled sequence to a tree.
  ‘lerw’ performs a loop-erased random walk on the complete graph to
  uniformly sampleits spanning trees. (This is also known as Wilson's
  algorithm). The default is ‘lerw’. Note that the method based on
  Prüfer sequences does not support directed trees at the moment.

## Value

A graph object.

## Details

In other words, the function generates each possible labelled tree with
the given number of nodes with the same probability.
