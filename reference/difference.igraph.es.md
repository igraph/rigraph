# Difference of edge sequences

Difference of edge sequences

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'igraph.es'
difference(big, small, ...)
```

## Arguments

- big:

  The ‘big’ edge sequence.

- small:

  The ‘small’ edge sequence.

- ...:

  Ignored, included for S3 signature compatibility.

## Value

An edge sequence that contains only edges that are part of `big`, but
not part of `small`.

## Details

They must belong to the same graph. Note that this function has ‘set’
semantics and the multiplicity of edges is lost in the result.
