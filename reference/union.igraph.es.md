# Union of edge sequences

Union of edge sequences

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'igraph.es'
union(...)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  The edge sequences to take the union of.

## Value

An edge sequence that contains all edges in the given sequences, exactly
once.

## Details

They must belong to the same graph. Note that this function has ‘set’
semantics and the multiplicity of edges is lost in the result. (This is
to match the behavior of the based `unique` function.)

g <- make_(ring(10), with_vertex_(name = LETTERS[1:10]))
union(E(g)[1:6], E(g)[5:9], E(g)["A|J"])
#> + 10/10 edges from 95cafec (vertex names):
#>  [1] A--B B--C C--D D--E E--F F--G G--H H--I I--J A--J
