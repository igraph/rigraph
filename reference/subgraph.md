# Subgraph of a graph

`subgraph()` creates a subgraph of a graph, containing only the
specified vertices and all the edges among them.

## Usage

``` r
subgraph(graph, vids)

induced_subgraph(
  graph,
  vids,
  impl = c("auto", "copy_and_delete", "create_from_scratch")
)

subgraph_from_edges(graph, eids, delete.vertices = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The original graph.

- vids:

  Numeric vector, the vertices of the original graph which will form the
  subgraph.

- impl:

  Character scalar, to choose between two implementation of the subgraph
  calculation. ‘`copy_and_delete`’ copies the graph first, and then
  deletes the vertices and edges that are not included in the result
  graph. ‘`create_from_scratch`’ searches for all vertices and edges
  that must be kept and then uses them to create the graph from scratch.
  ‘`auto`’ chooses between the two implementations automatically, using
  heuristics based on the size of the original and the result graph.

- eids:

  The edge ids of the edges that will be kept in the result graph.

- delete.vertices:

  Logical scalar, whether to remove vertices that do not have any
  adjacent edges in `eids`.

## Value

A new graph object.

## Details

`induced_subgraph()` calculates the induced subgraph of a set of
vertices in a graph. This means that exactly the specified vertices and
all the edges between them will be kept in the result graph.

`subgraph_from_edges()` calculates the subgraph of a graph. For this
function one can specify the vertices and edges to keep. This function
will be renamed to `subgraph()` in the next major version of igraph.

The `subgraph()` function currently does the same as
`induced_subgraph()` (assuming ‘`auto`’ as the `impl` argument), but
this behaviour is deprecated. In the next major version, `subgraph()`
will overtake the functionality of `subgraph_from_edges()`.
