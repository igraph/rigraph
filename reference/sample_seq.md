# Sampling a random integer sequence

This function provides a very efficient way to pull an integer random
sample sequence from an integer interval.

## Usage

``` r
sample_seq(low, high, length)
```

## Arguments

- low:

  The lower limit of the interval (inclusive).

- high:

  The higher limit of the interval (inclusive).

- length:

  The length of the sample.

## Value

An increasing numeric vector containing integers, the sample.

## Details

The algorithm runs in `O(length)` expected time, even if `high-low` is
big. It is much faster (but of course less general) than the builtin
`sample` function of R.
