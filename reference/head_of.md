# Head of the edge(s) in a graph

For undirected graphs, head and tail is not defined. In this case
`head_of()` returns vertices incident to the supplied edges, and
[`tail_of()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/tail_of.md) returns the
other end(s) of the edge(s).

## Usage

``` r
head_of(graph, es)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph.

- es:

  The edges to query.

## Value

A vertex sequence with the head(s) of the edge(s).
