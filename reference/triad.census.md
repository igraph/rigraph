# Triad census, subgraphs with three vertices

**\[deprecated\]**

`triad.census()` was renamed to
[`triad_census()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/triad_census.md) to
create a more consistent API.

## Usage

``` r
triad.census(graph)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph, it should be directed. An undirected graph results a
  warning, and undefined results.
