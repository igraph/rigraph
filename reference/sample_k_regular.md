# Create a random regular graph

Generate a random graph where each vertex has the same degree.

## Usage

``` r
sample_k_regular(no.of.nodes, k, directed = FALSE, multiple = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- no.of.nodes:

  Integer scalar, the number of vertices in the generated graph.

- k:

  Integer scalar, the degree of each vertex in the graph, or the
  out-degree and in-degree in a directed graph.

- directed:

  Logical scalar, whether to create a directed graph.

- multiple:

  Logical scalar, whether multiple edges are allowed.

## Value

An igraph graph.

## Details

This game generates a directed or undirected random graph where the
degrees of vertices are equal to a predefined constant k. For undirected
graphs, at least one of k and the number of vertices must be even.

The game simply uses
[`sample_degseq()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/sample_degseq.md)
with appropriately constructed degree sequences.

## See also

[`sample_degseq()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/sample_degseq.md) for
a generator with prescribed degree sequence.
