# Graph generation based on different vertex types

These functions implement evolving network models based on different
vertex types.

## Usage

``` r
sample_traits_callaway(
  nodes,
  types,
  edge.per.step = 1,
  type.dist = rep(1, types),
  pref.matrix = matrix(1, types, types),
  directed = FALSE
)

traits_callaway(...)

sample_traits(
  nodes,
  types,
  k = 1,
  type.dist = rep(1, types),
  pref.matrix = matrix(1, types, types),
  directed = FALSE
)

traits(...)
```

## Arguments

- nodes:

  The number of vertices in the graph.

- types:

  The number of different vertex types.

- edge.per.step:

  The number of edges to add to the graph per time step.

- type.dist:

  The distribution of the vertex types. This is assumed to be stationary
  in time.

- pref.matrix:

  A matrix giving the preferences of the given vertex types. These
  should be probabilities, i.e. numbers between zero and one.

- directed:

  Logical constant, whether to generate directed graphs.

- ...:

  Passed to the constructor, `sample_traits()` or
  `sample_traits_callaway()`.

- k:

  The number of trials per time step, see details below.

## Value

A new graph object.

## Details

For `sample_traits_callaway()` the simulation goes like this: in each
discrete time step a new vertex is added to the graph. The type of this
vertex is generated based on `type.dist`. Then two vertices are selected
uniformly randomly from the graph. The probability that they will be
connected depends on the types of these vertices and is taken from
`pref.matrix`. Then another two vertices are selected and this is
repeated `edges.per.step` times in each time step.

For `sample_traits()` the simulation goes like this: a single vertex is
added at each time step. This new vertex tries to connect to `k`
vertices in the graph. The probability that such a connection is
realized depends on the types of the vertices involved and is taken from
`pref.matrix`.
