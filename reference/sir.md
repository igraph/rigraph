# SIR model on graphs

Run simulations for an SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model, on a
graph

## Usage

``` r
time_bins(x, middle = TRUE)

# S3 method for class 'sir'
time_bins(x, middle = TRUE)

# S3 method for class 'sir'
median(x, na.rm = FALSE, ...)

# S3 method for class 'sir'
quantile(x, comp = c("NI", "NS", "NR"), prob, ...)

sir(graph, beta, gamma, no.sim = 100)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `sir` object, returned by the `sir()` function.

- middle:

  Logical scalar, whether to return the middle of the time bins, or the
  boundaries.

- na.rm:

  Logical scalar, whether to ignore `NA` values. `sir` objects do not
  contain any `NA` values currently, so this argument is effectively
  ignored.

- ...:

  Additional arguments, ignored currently.

- comp:

  Character scalar. The component to calculate the quantile of. `NI` is
  infected agents, `NS` is susceptibles, `NR` stands for recovered.

- prob:

  Numeric vector of probabilities, in \[0,1\], they specify the
  quantiles to calculate.

- graph:

  The graph to run the model on. If directed, then edge directions are
  ignored and a warning is given.

- beta:

  Non-negative scalar. The rate of infection of an individual that is
  susceptible and has a single infected neighbor. The infection rate of
  a susceptible individual with n infected neighbors is n times beta.
  Formally this is the rate parameter of an exponential distribution.

- gamma:

  Positive scalar. The rate of recovery of an infected individual.
  Formally, this is the rate parameter of an exponential distribution.

- no.sim:

  Integer scalar, the number simulation runs to perform.

## Value

For `sir()` the results are returned in an object of class ‘`sir`’,
which is a list, with one element for each simulation. Each simulation
is itself a list with the following elements. They are all numeric
vectors, with equal length:

- times:

  The times of the events.

- NS:

  The number of susceptibles in the population, over time.

- NI:

  The number of infected individuals in the population, over time.

- NR:

  The number of recovered individuals in the population, over time.

Function `time_bins()` returns a numeric vector, the middle or the
boundaries of the time bins, depending on the `middle` argument.

`median` returns a list of three named numeric vectors, `NS`, `NI` and
`NR`. The names within the vectors are created from the time bins.

`quantile` returns the same vector as `median` (but only one, the one
requested) if only one quantile is requested. If multiple quantiles are
requested, then a list of these vectors is returned, one for each
quantile.

## Details

The SIR model is a simple model from epidemiology. The individuals of
the population might be in three states: susceptible, infected and
recovered. Recovered people are assumed to be immune to the disease.
Susceptibles become infected with a rate that depends on their number of
infected neighbors. Infected people become recovered with a constant
rate.

The function `sir()` simulates the model. This function runs multiple
simulations, all starting with a single uniformly randomly chosen
infected individual. A simulation is stopped when no infected
individuals are left.

Function `time_bins()` bins the simulation steps, using the
Freedman-Diaconis heuristics to determine the bin width.

Function `median` and `quantile` calculate the median and quantiles of
the results, respectively, in bins calculated with `time_bins()`.
