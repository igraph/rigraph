# Graph rewiring while preserving the degree distribution

This function can be used together with
[`rewire()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/rewire.md) to randomly
rewire the edges while preserving the original graph's degree
distribution.

## Usage

``` r
keeping_degseq(loops = FALSE, niter = 100)
```

## Arguments

- loops:

  Whether to allow destroying and creating loop edges.

- niter:

  Number of rewiring trials to perform.

## Details

The rewiring algorithm chooses two arbitrary edges in each step ((a,b)
and (c,d)) and substitutes them with (a,d) and (c,b), if they not
already exists in the graph. The algorithm does not create multiple
edges.

``` r
g <- make_ring(10)
g %>%
  rewire(keeping_degseq(niter = 20)) %>%
  degree()
#>  [1] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
print_all(rewire(g, with = keeping_degseq(niter = vcount(g) * 10)))
#> IGRAPH 933c9a4 U--- 10 10 -- Ring graph
#> + attr: name (g/c), mutual (g/l), circular (g/l)
#> + graph attributes:
#> | + name:
#> |   [1] "Ring graph"
#> | + mutual:
#> |   [1] FALSE
#> | + circular:
#> |   [1] TRUE
