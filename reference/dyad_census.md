# Dyad census of a graph

Classify dyads in a directed graphs. The relationship between each pair
of vertices is measured. It can be in three states: mutual, asymmetric
or non-existent.

## Usage

``` r
dyad_census(graph)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph. A warning is given if it is not directed.

## Value

A named numeric vector with three elements:

- mut:

  The number of pairs with mutual connections.

- asym:

  The number of pairs with non-mutual connections.

- null:

  The number of pairs with no connection between them.
