# List all minimum \\(s,t)\\-cuts of a graph

Listing all minimum \\(s,t)\\-cuts of a directed graph, for given \\s\\
and \\t\\.

## Usage

``` r
st_min_cuts(graph, source, target, capacity = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph. It must be directed.

- source:

  The id of the source vertex.

- target:

  The id of the target vertex.

- capacity:

  Numeric vector giving the edge capacities. If this is `NULL` and the
  graph has a `weight` edge attribute, then this attribute defines the
  edge capacities. For forcing unit edge capacities, even for graphs
  that have a `weight` edge attribute, supply `NA` here.

## Value

A list with entries:

- value:

  Numeric scalar, the size of the minimum cut(s).

- cuts:

  A list of numeric vectors containing edge ids. Each vector is a
  minimum \\(s,t)\\-cut.

- partition1s:

  A list of numeric vectors containing vertex ids, they correspond to
  the edge cuts. Each vertex set is a generator of the corresponding
  cut, i.e. in the graph \\G=(V,E)\\, the vertex set \\X\\ and its
  complementer \\V-X\\, generates the cut that contains exactly the
  edges that go from \\X\\ to \\V-X\\.

## Details

Given a \\G\\ directed graph and two, different and non-ajacent
vertices, \\s\\ and \\t\\, an \\(s,t)\\-cut is a set of edges, such that
after removing these edges from \\G\\ there is no directed path from
\\s\\ to \\t\\.

The size of an \\(s,t)\\-cut is defined as the sum of the capacities (or
weights) in the cut. For unweighted (=equally weighted) graphs, this is
simply the number of edges.

An \\(s,t)\\-cut is minimum if it is of the smallest possible size.
