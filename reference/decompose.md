# Decompose a graph into components

Creates a separate graph for each connected component of a graph.

## Usage

``` r
decompose(graph, mode = c("weak", "strong"), max.comps = NA, min.vertices = 0)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The original graph.

- mode:

  Character constant giving the type of the components, wither `weak`
  for weakly connected components or `strong` for strongly connected
  components.

- max.comps:

  The maximum number of components to return. The first `max.comps`
  components will be returned (which hold at least `min.vertices`
  vertices, see the next parameter), the others will be ignored. Supply
  `NA` here if you don't want to limit the number of components.

- min.vertices:

  The minimum number of vertices a component should contain in order to
  place it in the result list. E.g. supply 2 here to ignore isolate
  vertices.

## Value

A list of graph objects.

``` r
# the diameter of each component in a random graph
g <- sample_gnp(1000, 1 / 1000)
components <- decompose(g, min.vertices = 2)
sapply(components, diameter)
