# Remove duplicate vertices from a vertex sequence

Remove duplicate vertices from a vertex sequence

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'igraph.vs'
unique(x, incomparables = FALSE, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A vertex sequence.

- incomparables:

  a vector of values that cannot be compared. Passed to base function
  `duplicated`. See details there.

- ...:

  Passed to base function
  [`duplicated()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/duplicated.html).

## Value

A vertex sequence with the duplicate vertices removed.
