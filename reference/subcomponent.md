# In- or out- component of a vertex

Finds all vertices reachable from a given vertex, or the opposite: all
vertices from which a given vertex is reachable via a directed path.

## Usage

``` r
subcomponent(graph, v, mode = c("all", "out", "in"))
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The graph to analyze.

- v:

  The vertex to start the search from.

- mode:

  Character string, either “in”, “out” or “all”. If “in” all vertices
  from which `v` is reachable are listed. If “out” all vertices
  reachable from `v` are returned. If “all” returns the union of these.
  It is ignored for undirected graphs.

## Value

Numeric vector, the ids of the vertices in the same component as `v`.

## Details

A breadth-first search is conducted starting from vertex `v`.
