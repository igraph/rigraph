# Helper function for adding and deleting vertices

This is a helper function that simplifies adding and deleting vertices
to/from graphs.

## Usage

``` r
vertex(...)

vertices(...)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  See details below.

## Value

A special object that can be used with together with igraph graphs and
the plus and minus operators.

## Details

`vertices()` is an alias for `vertex()`.

When adding vertices via `+`, all unnamed arguments are interpreted as
vertex names of the new vertices. Named arguments are interpreted as
vertex attributes for the new vertices.

When deleting vertices via `-`, all arguments of `vertex()` (or
`vertices()`) are concatenated via
[`c()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html) and passed to
[`delete_vertices()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/delete_vertices.md).

  vertices("X", "Y")
g
#> IGRAPH 02d9cba UN-- 12 10 -- Ring graph
