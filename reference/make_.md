# Make a new graph

This is a generic function for creating graphs.

## Usage

``` r
make_(...)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Parameters, see details below.

## Details

`make_()` is a generic function for creating graphs. For every graph
constructor in igraph that has a `make_` prefix, there is a
corresponding function without the prefix: e.g. for
[`make_ring()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/make_ring.md) there is
also [`ring()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/make_ring.md), etc.

The same is true for the random graph samplers, i.e. for each
constructor with a `sample_` prefix, there is a corresponding function
without that prefix.

These shorter forms can be used together with `make_()`. The advantage
of this form is that the user can specify constructor modifiers which
work with all constructors. E.g. the
[`with_vertex_()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/with_vertex_.md)
modifier adds vertex attributes to the newly created graphs.

See the examples and the various constructor modifiers below.

l <- make_(lattice(c(3, 3, 3)))

r2 <- make_(ring(10), with_vertex_(color = "red", name = LETTERS[1:10]))
l2 <- make_(lattice(c(3, 3, 3)), with_edge_(weight = 2))

ran <- sample_(degseq(c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3), method = "configuration"), simplified())
degree(ran)
#> [1] 3 3 3 3 3 3
is_simple(ran)
#> [1] TRUE
