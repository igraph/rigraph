# K-core decomposition of graphs

The k-core of graph is a maximal subgraph in which each vertex has at
least degree k. The coreness of a vertex is k if it belongs to the
k-core but not to the (k+1)-core.

## Usage

``` r
coreness(graph, mode = c("all", "out", "in"))
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph, it can be directed or undirected

- mode:

  The type of the core in directed graphs. Character constant, possible
  values: `in`: in-cores are computed, `out`: out-cores are computed,
  `all`: the corresponding undirected graph is considered. This argument
  is ignored for undirected graphs.

## Value

Numeric vector of integer numbers giving the coreness of each vertex.

## Details

The k-core of a graph is the maximal subgraph in which every vertex has
at least degree k. The cores of a graph form layers: the (k+1)-core is
always a subgraph of the k-core.

This function calculates the coreness for each vertex.
