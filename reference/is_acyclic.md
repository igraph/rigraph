# Acyclic graphs

This function tests whether the given graph is free of cycles.

## Usage

``` r
is_acyclic(graph)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph.

## Value

A logical vector of length one.

## Details

This function looks for directed cycles in directed graphs and
undirected cycles in undirected graphs. Use
[`find_cycle()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/find_cycle.md) to return
a specific cycle.
