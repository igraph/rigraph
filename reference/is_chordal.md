# Chordality of a graph

A graph is chordal (or triangulated) if each of its cycles of four or
more nodes has a chord, which is an edge joining two nodes that are not
adjacent in the cycle. An equivalent definition is that any chordless
cycles have at most three nodes.

## Usage

``` r
is_chordal(
  graph,
  alpha = NULL,
  alpham1 = NULL,
  fillin = FALSE,
  newgraph = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph. It may be directed, but edge directions are ignored,
  as the algorithm is defined for undirected graphs.

- alpha:

  Numeric vector, the maximal chardinality ordering of the vertices. If
  it is `NULL`, then it is automatically calculated by calling
  [`max_cardinality()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/max_cardinality.md),
  or from `alpham1` if that is given..

- alpham1:

  Numeric vector, the inverse of `alpha`. If it is `NULL`, then it is
  automatically calculated by calling
  [`max_cardinality()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/max_cardinality.md),
  or from `alpha`.

- fillin:

  Logical scalar, whether to calculate the fill-in edges.

- newgraph:

  Logical scalar, whether to calculate the triangulated graph.

## Value

A list with three members:

- chordal:

  Logical scalar, it is `TRUE` iff the input graph is chordal.

- fillin:

  If requested, then a numeric vector giving the fill-in edges. `NULL`
  otherwise.

- newgraph:

  If requested, then the triangulated graph, an `igraph` object. `NULL`
  otherwise.

## Details

The chordality of the graph is decided by first performing maximum
cardinality search on it (if the `alpha` and `alpham1` arguments are
`NULL`), and then calculating the set of fill-in edges.

The set of fill-in edges is empty if and only if the graph is chordal.

It is also true that adding the fill-in edges to the graph makes it
chordal.
