# Voronoi partitioning of a graph

**\[experimental\]**

This function partitions the vertices of a graph based on a set of
generator vertices. Each vertex is assigned to the generator vertex from
(or to) which it is closest.

[`groups()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/groups.md) may be used on
the output of this function.

## Usage

``` r
voronoi_cells(
  graph,
  generators,
  ...,
  weights = NULL,
  mode = c("out", "in", "all", "total"),
  tiebreaker = c("random", "first", "last")
)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The graph to partition into Voronoi cells.

- generators:

  The generator vertices of the Voronoi cells.

- ...:

  These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.

- weights:

  Possibly a numeric vector giving edge weights. If this is `NULL` and
  the graph has a `weight` edge attribute, then the attribute is used.
  If this is `NA` then no weights are used (even if the graph has a
  `weight` attribute). In a weighted graph, the length of a path is the
  sum of the weights of its constituent edges.

- mode:

  Character string. In directed graphs, whether to compute distances
  from generator vertices to other vertices (`"out"`), to generator
  vertices from other vertices (`"in"`), or ignore edge directions
  entirely (`"all"`). Ignored in undirected graphs.

- tiebreaker:

  Character string that specifies what to do when a vertex is at the
  same distance from multiple generators. `"random"` assigns a
  minimal-distance generator randomly, `"first"` takes the first one,
  and `"last"` takes the last one.

## Value

A named list with two components:

- membership:

  numeric vector giving the cluster id to which each vertex belongs.

- distances:

  numeric vector giving the distance of each vertex from its generator
