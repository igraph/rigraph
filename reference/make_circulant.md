# Create a circulant graph

A circulant graph \\C_n^{\textrm{shifts}}\\ consists of \\n\\ vertices
\\v_0, \ldots, v\_{n-1}\\ such that for each \\s_i\\ in the list of
offsets `shifts`, \\v_j\\ is connected to \\v\_{(j + s_i) \mod n}\\ for
all \\j\\.

## Usage

``` r
make_circulant(n, shifts, directed = FALSE)

circulant(...)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  Integer, the number of vertices in the circulant graph.

- shifts:

  Integer vector, a list of the offsets within the circulant graph.

- directed:

  Boolean, whether to create a directed graph.

- ...:

  Passed to `make_circulant()`.

## Value

An igraph graph.

## Details

The function can generate either directed or undirected graphs. It does
not generate multi-edges or self-loops.

# Create a circulant graph with 10 vertices and shifts 1 and 3
g <- make_circulant(10, c(1, 3))
plot(g, layout = layout_in_circle)


# A directed circulant graph
g2 <- make_circulant(10, c(1, 3), directed = TRUE)
plot(g2, layout = layout_in_circle)
```
