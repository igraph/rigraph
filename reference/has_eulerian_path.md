# Find Eulerian paths or cycles in a graph

`has_eulerian_path()` and `has_eulerian_cycle()` checks whether there is
an Eulerian path or cycle in the input graph. `eulerian_path()` and
`eulerian_cycle()` return such a path or cycle if it exists, and throws
an error otherwise.

## Usage

``` r
has_eulerian_path(graph)

has_eulerian_cycle(graph)

eulerian_path(graph)

eulerian_cycle(graph)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  An igraph graph object

## Value

For `has_eulerian_path()` and `has_eulerian_cycle()`, a logical value
that indicates whether the graph contains an Eulerian path or cycle. For
`eulerian_path()` and `eulerian_cycle()`, a named list with two entries:

- epath:

  A vector containing the edge ids along the Eulerian path or cycle.

- vpath:

  A vector containing the vertex ids along the Eulerian path or cycle.

## Details

`has_eulerian_path()` decides whether the input graph has an Eulerian
*path*, i.e. a path that passes through every edge of the graph exactly
once, and returns a logical value as a result. `eulerian_path()` returns
a possible Eulerian path, described with its edge and vertex sequence,
or throws an error if no such path exists.

`has_eulerian_cycle()` decides whether the input graph has an Eulerian
*cycle*, i.e. a path that passes through every edge of the graph exactly
once and that returns to its starting point, and returns a logical value
as a result. `eulerian_cycle()` returns a possible Eulerian cycle,
described with its edge and vertex sequence, or throws an error if no
such cycle exists.
