# Disjoint union of graphs

The union of two or more graphs are created. The graphs are assumed to
have disjoint vertex sets.

## Usage

``` r
disjoint_union(...)

x %du% y
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Graph objects or lists of graph objects.

- x, y:

  Graph objects.

## Value

A new graph object.

## Details

`disjoint_union()` creates a union of two or more disjoint graphs. Thus
first the vertices in the second, third, etc. graphs are relabeled to
have completely disjoint graphs. Then a simple union is created. This
function can also be used via the `%du%` operator.

`disjoint_union()` handles graph, vertex and edge attributes. In
particular, it merges vertex and edge attributes using the
[`vctrs::vec_c()`](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/reference/vec_c.html)
function. For graphs that lack some vertex/edge attribute, the
corresponding values in the new graph are set to a missing value (`NA`
for scalar attributes, `NULL` for list attributes). Graph attributes are
simply copied to the result. If this would result a name clash, then
they are renamed by adding suffixes: \_1, \_2, etc.

Note that if both graphs have vertex names (i.e. a `name` vertex
attribute), then the concatenated vertex names might be non-unique in
the result. A warning is given if this happens.

An error is generated if some input graphs are directed and others are
undirected.
