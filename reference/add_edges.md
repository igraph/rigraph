# Add edges to a graph

The new edges are given as a vertex sequence, e.g. internal numeric
vertex ids, or vertex names. The first edge points from `edges[1]` to
`edges[2]`, the second from `edges[3]` to `edges[4]`, etc.

## Usage

``` r
add_edges(graph, edges, ..., attr = list())
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph

- edges:

  The edges to add, a vertex sequence with even number of vertices.

- ...:

  Additional arguments, they must be named, and they will be added as
  edge attributes, for the newly added edges. See also details below.

- attr:

  A named list, its elements will be added as edge attributes, for the
  newly added edges. See also details below.

## Value

The graph, with the edges (and attributes) added.

## Details

If attributes are supplied, and they are not present in the graph, their
values for the original edges of the graph are set to `NA`.
