# Optimal edge curvature when plotting graphs

If graphs have multiple edges, then drawing them as straight lines does
not show them when plotting the graphs; they will be on top of each
other. One solution is to bend the edges, with diffenent curvature, so
that all of them are visible.

## Usage

``` r
curve_multiple(graph, start = 0.5)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph.

- start:

  The curvature at the two extreme edges. All edges will have a
  curvature between `-start` and `start`, spaced equally.

## Value

A numeric vector, its length is the number of edges in the graph.

## Details

`curve_multiple()` calculates the optimal `edge.curved` vector for
plotting a graph with multiple edges, so that all edges are visible.
