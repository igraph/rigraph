# Topological sorting of vertices in a graph

A topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph is a linear ordering
of its nodes where each node comes before all nodes to which it has
edges.

## Usage

``` r
topo_sort(graph, mode = c("out", "all", "in"))
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph, should be directed

- mode:

  Specifies how to use the direction of the edges. For “`out`”, the
  sorting order ensures that each node comes before all nodes to which
  it has edges, so nodes with no incoming edges go first. For “`in`”, it
  is quite the opposite: each node comes before all nodes from which it
  receives edges. Nodes with no outgoing edges go first.

## Value

A vertex sequence (by default, but see the `return.vs.es` option of
[`igraph_options()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/igraph_options.md))
containing vertices in topologically sorted order.

## Details

Every DAG has at least one topological sort, and may have many. This
function returns a possible topological sort among them. If the graph is
not acyclic (it has at least one cycle), a partial topological sort is
returned and a warning is issued.
