# Closeness centrality of vertices

Closeness centrality measures how many steps are required to access
every other vertex from a given vertex.

## Usage

``` r
closeness(
  graph,
  vids = V(graph),
  mode = c("out", "in", "all", "total"),
  weights = NULL,
  normalized = FALSE,
  cutoff = -1
)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The graph to analyze.

- vids:

  The vertices for which closeness will be calculated.

- mode:

  Character string, defined the types of the paths used for measuring
  the distance in directed graphs. “in” measures the paths *to* a
  vertex, “out” measures paths *from* a vertex, *all* uses undirected
  paths. This argument is ignored for undirected graphs.

- weights:

  Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted closeness. If
  the graph has a `weight` edge attribute, then this is used by default.
  Weights are used for calculating weighted shortest paths, so they are
  interpreted as distances.

- normalized:

  Logical scalar, whether to calculate the normalized closeness, i.e.
  the inverse average distance to all reachable vertices. The
  non-normalized closeness is the inverse of the sum of distances to all
  reachable vertices.

- cutoff:

  The maximum path length to consider when calculating the closeness. If
  zero or negative then there is no such limit.

## Value

Numeric vector with the closeness values of all the vertices in `v`.

## Details

The closeness centrality of a vertex is defined as the inverse of the
sum of distances to all the other vertices in the graph:

\$\$\frac{1}{\sum\_{i\ne v} d\_{vi}}\$\$

If there is no (directed) path between vertex `v` and `i`, then `i` is
omitted from the calculation. If no other vertices are reachable from
`v`, then its closeness is returned as NaN.

`cutoff` or smaller. This can be run for larger graphs, as the running
time is not quadratic (if `cutoff` is small). If `cutoff` is negative
(which is the default), then the function calculates the exact closeness
scores. Since igraph 1.6.0, a `cutoff` value of zero is treated
literally, i.e. path with a length greater than zero are ignored.

Closeness centrality is meaningful only for connected graphs. In
disconnected graphs, consider using the harmonic centrality with
[`harmonic_centrality()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/harmonic_centrality.md)
