# Finding a feedback arc set in a graph

A feedback arc set of a graph is a subset of edges whose removal breaks
all cycles in the graph.

## Usage

``` r
feedback_arc_set(graph, weights = NULL, algo = c("approx_eades", "exact_ip"))
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph

- weights:

  Potential edge weights. If the graph has an edge attribute called
  ‘`weight`’, and this argument is `NULL`, then the edge attribute is
  used automatically. The goal of the feedback arc set problem is to
  find a feedback arc set with the smallest total weight.

- algo:

  Specifies the algorithm to use. “`exact_ip`” solves the feedback arc
  set problem with an exact integer programming algorithm that
  guarantees that the total weight of the removed edges is as small as
  possible. “`approx_eades`” uses a fast (linear-time) approximation
  algorithm from Eades, Lin and Smyth. “`exact`” is an alias to
  “`exact_ip`” while “`approx`” is an alias to “`approx_eades`”.

## Value

An edge sequence (by default, but see the `return.vs.es` option of
[`igraph_options()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/igraph_options.md))
containing the feedback arc set.

## Details

Feedback arc sets are typically used in directed graphs. The removal of
a feedback arc set of a directed graph ensures that the remaining graph
is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For undirected graphs, the removal of
a feedback arc set ensures that the remaining graph is a forest (i.e.
every connected component is a tree).
