# Infomap community finding

Find community structure that minimizes the expected description length
of a random walker trajectory. If the graph is directed, edge directions
will be taken into account.

## Usage

``` r
cluster_infomap(
  graph,
  e.weights = NULL,
  v.weights = NULL,
  nb.trials = 10,
  modularity = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph. Edge directions will be taken into account.

- e.weights:

  If not `NULL`, then a numeric vector of edge weights. The length must
  match the number of edges in the graph. By default the ‘`weight`’ edge
  attribute is used as weights. If it is not present, then all edges are
  considered to have the same weight. Larger edge weights correspond to
  stronger connections.

- v.weights:

  If not `NULL`, then a numeric vector of vertex weights. The length
  must match the number of vertices in the graph. By default the
  ‘`weight`’ vertex attribute is used as weights. If it is not present,
  then all vertices are considered to have the same weight. A larger
  vertex weight means a larger probability that the random surfer jumps
  to that vertex.

- nb.trials:

  The number of attempts to partition the network (can be any integer
  value equal or larger than 1).

- modularity:

  Logical scalar, whether to calculate the modularity score of the
  detected community structure.

## Value

`cluster_infomap()` returns a
[`communities()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/communities.md) object,
please see the
[`communities()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/communities.md) manual
page for details.

Martin Rosvall wrote the original C++ code. This was ported to be more
igraph-like by Emmanuel Navarro. The R interface and some cosmetics was
done by Gabor Csardi <csardi.gabor@gmail.com>.
