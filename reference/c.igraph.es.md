# Concatenate edge sequences

Concatenate edge sequences

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'igraph.es'
c(..., recursive = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  The edge sequences to concatenate. They must all refer to the same
  graph.

- recursive:

  Ignored, included for S3 compatibility with the base `c` function.

## Value

An edge sequence, the input sequences concatenated.
