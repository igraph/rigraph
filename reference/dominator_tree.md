# Dominator tree

Dominator tree of a directed graph.

## Usage

``` r
dominator_tree(graph, root, mode = c("out", "in", "all", "total"))
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  A directed graph. If it is not a flowgraph, and it contains some
  vertices not reachable from the root vertex, then these vertices will
  be collected and returned as part of the result.

- root:

  The id of the root (or source) vertex, this will be the root of the
  tree.

- mode:

  Constant, must be ‘`in`’ or ‘`out`’. If it is ‘`in`’, then all
  directions are considered as opposite to the original one in the input
  graph.

## Value

A list with components:

- dom:

  A numeric vector giving the immediate dominators for each vertex. For
  vertices that are unreachable from the root, it contains `NaN`. For
  the root vertex itself it contains minus one.

- domtree:

  A graph object, the dominator tree. Its vertex ids are the as the
  vertex ids of the input graph. Isolate vertices are the ones that are
  unreachable from the root.

- leftout:

  A numeric vector containing the vertex ids that are unreachable from
  the root.

## Details

A flowgraph is a directed graph with a distinguished start (or root)
vertex \\r\\, such that for any vertex \\v\\, there is a path from \\r\\
to \\v\\. A vertex \\v\\ dominates another vertex \\w\\ (not equal to
\\v\\), if every path from \\r\\ to \\w\\ contains \\v\\. Vertex \\v\\
is the immediate dominator or \\w\\, \\v=\textrm{idom}(w)\\, if \\v\\
dominates \\w\\ and every other dominator of \\w\\ dominates \\v\\. The
edges \\{(\textrm{idom}(w), w)\| w \ne r}\\ form a directed tree, rooted
at \\r\\, called the dominator tree of the graph. Vertex \\v\\ dominates
vertex \\w\\ if and only if \\v\\ is an ancestor of \\w\\ in the
dominator tree.

This function implements the Lengauer-Tarjan algorithm to construct the
dominator tree of a directed graph. For details see the reference below.
