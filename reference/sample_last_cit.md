# Random citation graphs

`sample_last_cit()` creates a graph, where vertices age, and gain new
connections based on how long ago their last citation happened.

## Usage

``` r
sample_last_cit(
  n,
  edges = 1,
  agebins = n/7100,
  pref = (1:(agebins + 1))^-3,
  directed = TRUE
)

last_cit(...)

sample_cit_types(
  n,
  edges = 1,
  types = rep(0, n),
  pref = rep(1, length(types)),
  directed = TRUE,
  attr = TRUE
)

cit_types(...)

sample_cit_cit_types(
  n,
  edges = 1,
  types = rep(0, n),
  pref = matrix(1, nrow = length(types), ncol = length(types)),
  directed = TRUE,
  attr = TRUE
)

cit_cit_types(...)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  Number of vertices.

- edges:

  Number of edges per step.

- agebins:

  Number of aging bins.

- pref:

  Vector (`sample_last_cit()` and `sample_cit_types()` or matrix
  (`sample_cit_cit_types()`) giving the (unnormalized) citation
  probabilities for the different vertex types.

- directed:

  Logical scalar, whether to generate directed networks.

- ...:

  Passed to the actual constructor.

- types:

  Vector of length ‘`n`’, the types of the vertices. Types are numbered
  from zero.

- attr:

  Logical scalar, whether to add the vertex types to the generated graph
  as a vertex attribute called ‘`type`’.

## Value

A new graph.

## Details

`sample_cit_cit_types()` is a stochastic block model where the graph is
growing.

`sample_cit_types()` is similarly a growing stochastic block model, but
the probability of an edge depends on the (potentially) cited vertex
only.
