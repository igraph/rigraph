# Independent vertex sets

A vertex set is called independent if there no edges between any two
vertices in it. These functions find independent vertex sets in
undirected graphs

## Usage

``` r
ivs(graph, min = NULL, max = NULL)

largest_ivs(graph)

max_ivs(graph)

ivs_size(graph)

independence_number(graph)

is_ivs(graph, candidate)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph.

- min:

  Numeric constant, limit for the minimum size of the independent vertex
  sets to find. `NULL` means no limit.

- max:

  Numeric constant, limit for the maximum size of the independent vertex
  sets to find. `NULL` means no limit.

- candidate:

  The vertex set to test for being an independent set.

## Value

`ivs()`, `largest_ivs()` and `max_ivs()` return a list containing
numeric vertex ids, each list element is an independent vertex set.

`ivs_size()` returns an integer constant.

`is_ivs()` returns `TRUE` if the candidate vertex set forms an
independent set.

## Details

`ivs()` finds all independent vertex sets in the network, obeying the
size limitations given in the `min` and `max` arguments.

`largest_ivs()` finds the largest independent vertex sets in the graph.
An independent vertex set is largest if there is no independent vertex
set with more vertices.

`max_ivs()` finds the maximal independent vertex sets in the graph. An
independent vertex set is maximal if it cannot be extended to a larger
independent vertex set. The largest independent vertex sets are maximal,
but the opposite is not always true.

`ivs_size()` calculate the size of the largest independent vertex
set(s).

`independence_number()` is an alias for `ivs_size()`.

These functions use the algorithm described by Tsukiyama et al., see
reference below.

`is_ivs()` tests if no pairs within a vertex set are connected.
