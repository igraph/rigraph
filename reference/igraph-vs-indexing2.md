# Select vertices and show their metadata

The double bracket operator can be used on vertex sequences, to print
the meta-data (vertex attributes) of the vertices in the sequence.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'igraph.vs'
x[[...]]
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A vertex sequence.

- ...:

  Additional arguments, passed to `[`.

## Value

The double bracket operator returns another vertex sequence, with
meta-data (attribute) printing turned on. See details below.

## Details

Technically, when used with vertex sequences, the double bracket
operator does exactly the same as the single bracket operator, but the
resulting vertex sequence is printed differently: all attributes of the
vertices in the sequence are printed as well.

[`[.igraph.vs`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/igraph-vs-indexing.md)
