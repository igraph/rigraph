# Transitive closure of a graph

**\[experimental\]**

Computes the transitive closure of a graph. The resulting graph will
have an edge from vertex \\i\\ to vertex \\j\\ if \\j\\ is reachable
from \\i\\ in the original graph.

The transitive closure of a graph is a new graph where there is an edge
between any two vertices if there is a path between them in the original
graph. For directed graphs, an edge from \\i\\ to \\j\\ is added if
there is a directed path from \\i\\ to \\j\\. For undirected graphs,
this is equivalent to connecting all vertices that are in the same
connected component.

## Usage

``` r
transitive_closure(graph)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph. It can be directed or undirected.

## Value

A new graph object representing the transitive closure. The returned
graph will have the same directedness as the input.

## Examples

``` r
# Directed graph
g <- make_graph(c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4))
tc <- transitive_closure(g)
# The closure has edges 1->2, 1->3, 1->4, 2->3, 2->4, 3->4
print_all(tc)
#> IGRAPH c414a58 D--- 4 6 -- 
#> + edges from c414a58:
#> [1] 1->2 1->3 1->4 2->3 2->4 3->4

# Undirected graph - connects all vertices in same component
g2 <- make_graph(c(1, 2, 3, 4), directed = FALSE)
tc2 <- transitive_closure(g2)
# Full graph on vertices 1, 2 and full graph on vertices 3, 4
print_all(tc2)
#> IGRAPH 4003f8d U--- 4 2 -- 
#> + edges from 4003f8d:
#> [1] 1--2 3--4
```
