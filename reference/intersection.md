# Intersection of two or more sets

This is an S3 generic function. See `methods("intersection")` for the
actual implementations for various S3 classes. Initially it is
implemented for igraph graphs and igraph vertex and edge sequences. See
[`intersection.igraph()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/intersection.igraph.md),
and
[`intersection.igraph.vs()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/intersection.igraph.vs.md).

## Usage

``` r
intersection(...)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Arguments, their number and interpretation depends on the function
  that implements `intersection()`.

## Value

Depends on the function that implements this method.
