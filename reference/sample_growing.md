# Growing random graph generation

This function creates a random graph by simulating its stochastic
evolution.

## Usage

``` r
sample_growing(n, m = 1, ..., directed = TRUE, citation = FALSE)

growing(...)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  Numeric constant, number of vertices in the graph.

- m:

  Numeric constant, number of edges added in each time step.

- ...:

  Passed to `sample_growing()`.

- directed:

  Logical, whether to create a directed graph.

- citation:

  Logical. If `TRUE` a citation graph is created, i.e. in each time step
  the added edges are originating from the new vertex.

## Value

A new graph object.

## Details

This is discrete time step model, in each time step a new vertex is
added to the graph and `m` new edges are created. If `citation` is
`FALSE` these edges are connecting two uniformly randomly chosen
vertices, otherwise the edges are connecting new vertex to uniformly
randomly chosen old vertices.
