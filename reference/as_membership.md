# Declare a numeric vector as a membership vector

This is useful if you want to use functions defined on membership
vectors, but your membership vector does not come from an igraph
clustering method.

## Usage

``` r
as_membership(x)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  The input vector.

## Value

The input vector, with the `membership` class added.

## Compare to the correct clustering
g <- (make_full_graph(10) + make_full_graph(10)) %>%
  rewire(each_edge(p = 0.2))
correct <- rep(1:2, each = 10) %>% as_membership()
fc <- cluster_fast_greedy(g)
compare(correct, fc)
#> [1] 0
compare(correct, membership(fc))
#> [1] 0
