# Create a wheel graph

**\[experimental\]**

A wheel graph is created by connecting a center vertex to all vertices
of a cycle graph. A wheel graph on `n` vertices can be thought of as a
wheel with `n - 1` spokes. The cycle graph part makes up the rim, while
the star graph part adds the spokes.

Note that the two and three-vertex wheel graphs are non-simple: The
two-vertex wheel graph contains a self-loop, while the three-vertex
wheel graph contains parallel edges (a 1-cycle and a 2-cycle,
respectively).

## Usage

``` r
make_wheel(n, ..., mode = c("in", "out", "mutual", "undirected"), center = 1)

wheel(...)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  Number of vertices.

- ...:

  Passed to `make_wheel()`.

- mode:

  It defines the direction of the edges. `in`: the edges point *to* the
  center, `out`: the edges point *from* the center, `mutual`: a directed
  wheel is created with mutual edges, `undirected`: the edges are
  undirected.

- center:

  ID of the center vertex.

## Value

An igraph graph.
