# Reverse edges in a graph

The new graph will contain the same vertices, edges and attributes as
the original graph, except that the direction of the edges selected by
their edge IDs in the `eids` argument will be reversed. When reversing
all edges, this operation is also known as graph transpose.

## Usage

``` r
reverse_edges(graph, eids = E(graph))

# S3 method for class 'igraph'
t(x)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph.

- eids:

  The edge IDs of the edges to reverse.

- x:

  The input graph.

## Value

The result graph where the direction of the edges with the given IDs are
reversed
