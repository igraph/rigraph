# Create an extended chordal ring graph

`make_chordal_ring()` creates an extended chordal ring. An extended
chordal ring is regular graph, each node has the same degree. It can be
obtained from a simple ring by adding some extra edges specified by a
matrix. Let p denote the number of columns in the ‘`W`’ matrix. The
extra edges of vertex `i` are added according to column `i mod p` in
‘`W`’. The number of extra edges is the number of rows in ‘`W`’: for
each row `j` an edge `i->i+w[ij]` is added if `i+w[ij]` is less than the
number of total nodes. See also Kotsis, G: Interconnection Topologies
for Parallel Processing Systems, PARS Mitteilungen 11, 1-6, 1993.

## Usage

``` r
make_chordal_ring(n, w, directed = FALSE)

chordal_ring(...)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  The number of vertices.

- w:

  A matrix which specifies the extended chordal ring. See details below.

- directed:

  Logical scalar, whether or not to create a directed graph.

- ...:

  Passed to `make_chordal_ring()`.

## Value

An igraph graph.
