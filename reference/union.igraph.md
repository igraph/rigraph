# Union of graphs

The union of two or more graphs are created. The graphs may have
identical or overlapping vertex sets.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'igraph'
union(..., byname = "auto")
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Graph objects or lists of graph objects.

- byname:

  A logical scalar, or the character scalar `auto`. Whether to perform
  the operation based on symbolic vertex names. If it is `auto`, that
  means `TRUE` if all graphs are named and `FALSE` otherwise. A warning
  is generated if `auto` and some (but not all) graphs are named.

## Value

A new graph object.

## Details

[`union()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/union.md) creates the union
of two or more graphs. Edges which are included in at least one graph
will be part of the new graph. This function can be also used via the
`%u%` operator.

If the `byname` argument is `TRUE` (or `auto` and all graphs are named),
then the operation is performed on symbolic vertex names instead of the
internal numeric vertex ids.

[`union()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/union.md) keeps the
attributes of all graphs. All graph, vertex and edge attributes are
copied to the result. If an attribute is present in multiple graphs and
would result a name clash, then this attribute is renamed by adding
suffixes: \_1, \_2, etc.

The `name` vertex attribute is treated specially if the operation is
performed based on symbolic vertex names. In this case `name` must be
present in all graphs, and it is not renamed in the result graph.

An error is generated if some input graphs are directed and others are
undirected.
