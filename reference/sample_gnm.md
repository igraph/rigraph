# Generate random graphs according to the \\G(n,m)\\ Erdős-Rényi model

Random graph with a fixed number of edges and vertices.

## Usage

``` r
sample_gnm(n, m, directed = FALSE, loops = FALSE)

gnm(...)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  The number of vertices in the graph.

- m:

  The number of edges in the graph.

- directed:

  Logical, whether the graph will be directed, defaults to `FALSE`.

- loops:

  Logical, whether to add loop edges, defaults to `FALSE`.

- ...:

  Passed to `sample_gnm()`.

## Value

A graph object.

## Details

The graph has `n` vertices and `m` edges. The edges are chosen uniformly
at random from the set of all vertex pairs. This set includes potential
self-connections as well if the `loops` parameter is `TRUE`.
