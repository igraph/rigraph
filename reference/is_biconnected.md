# Check biconnectedness

**\[experimental\]**

Tests whether a graph is biconnected.

## Usage

``` r
is_biconnected(graph)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph. Edge directions are ignored.

## Value

Logical, `TRUE` if the graph is biconnected.

## Details

A graph is biconnected if the removal of any single vertex (and its
adjacent edges) does not disconnect it.

igraph does not consider single-vertex graphs biconnected.

Note that some authors do not consider the graph consisting of two
connected vertices as biconnected, however, igraph does.
