# Contract several vertices into a single one

**\[deprecated\]**

`contract.vertices()` was renamed to
[`contract()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/contract.md) to create a
more consistent API.

## Usage

``` r
contract.vertices(
  graph,
  mapping,
  vertex.attr.comb = igraph_opt("vertex.attr.comb")
)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph, it can be directed or undirected.

- mapping:

  A numeric vector that specifies the mapping. Its elements correspond
  to the vertices, and for each element the id in the new graph is
  given.

- vertex.attr.comb:

  Specifies how to combine the vertex attributes in the new graph.
  Please see
  [`attribute.combination()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/igraph-attribute-combination.md)
  for details.
