# The DrL graph layout generator

DrL is a force-directed graph layout toolbox focused on real-world
large-scale graphs, developed by Shawn Martin and colleagues at Sandia
National Laboratories.

## Usage

``` r
layout_with_drl(
  graph,
  use.seed = FALSE,
  seed = matrix(runif(vcount(graph) * 2), ncol = 2),
  options = drl_defaults$default,
  weights = NULL,
  dim = c(2, 3)
)

with_drl(...)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph, in can be directed or undirected.

- use.seed:

  Logical scalar, whether to use the coordinates given in the `seed`
  argument as a starting point.

- seed:

  A matrix with two columns, the starting coordinates for the vertices
  is `use.seed` is `TRUE`. It is ignored otherwise.

- options:

  Options for the layout generator, a named list. See details below.

- weights:

  The weights of the edges. It must be a positive numeric vector, `NULL`
  or `NA`. If it is `NULL` and the input graph has a ‘weight’ edge
  attribute, then that attribute will be used. If `NULL` and no such
  attribute is present, then the edges will have equal weights. Set this
  to `NA` if the graph was a ‘weight’ edge attribute, but you don't want
  to use it for the layout. Larger edge weights correspond to stronger
  connections.

- dim:

  Either ‘2’ or ‘3’, it specifies whether we want a two dimensional or a
  three dimensional layout. Note that because of the nature of the DrL
  algorithm, the three dimensional layout takes significantly longer to
  compute.

- ...:

  Passed to `layout_with_drl()`.

## Value

A numeric matrix with two columns.

## Details

This function implements the force-directed DrL layout generator.

The generator has the following parameters:

- edge.cut:

  Edge cutting is done in the late stages of the algorithm in order to
  achieve less dense layouts. Edges are cut if there is a lot of stress
  on them (a large value in the objective function sum). The edge
  cutting parameter is a value between 0 and 1 with 0 representing no
  edge cutting and 1 representing maximal edge cutting.

- init.iterations:

  Number of iterations in the first phase.

- init.temperature:

  Start temperature, first phase.

- init.attraction:

  Attraction, first phase.

- init.damping.mult:

  Damping, first phase.

- liquid.iterations:

  Number of iterations, liquid phase.

- liquid.temperature:

  Start temperature, liquid phase.

- liquid.attraction:

  Attraction, liquid phase.

- liquid.damping.mult:

  Damping, liquid phase.

- expansion.iterations:

  Number of iterations, expansion phase.

- expansion.temperature:

  Start temperature, expansion phase.

- expansion.attraction:

  Attraction, expansion phase.

- expansion.damping.mult:

  Damping, expansion phase.

- cooldown.iterations:

  Number of iterations, cooldown phase.

- cooldown.temperature:

  Start temperature, cooldown phase.

- cooldown.attraction:

  Attraction, cooldown phase.

- cooldown.damping.mult:

  Damping, cooldown phase.

- crunch.iterations:

  Number of iterations, crunch phase.

- crunch.temperature:

  Start temperature, crunch phase.

- crunch.attraction:

  Attraction, crunch phase.

- crunch.damping.mult:

  Damping, crunch phase.

- simmer.iterations:

  Number of iterations, simmer phase.

- simmer.temperature:

  Start temperature, simmer phase.

- simmer.attraction:

  Attraction, simmer phase.

- simmer.damping.mult:

  Damping, simmer phase.

There are five pre-defined parameter settings as well, these are called
`drl_defaults$default`, `drl_defaults$coarsen`, `drl_defaults$coarsest`,
`drl_defaults$refine` and `drl_defaults$final`.
