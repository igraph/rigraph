# Various vertex shapes when plotting igraph graphs

**\[deprecated\]**

`vertex.shapes()` was renamed to
[`shapes()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/shapes.md) to create a more
consistent API.

## Usage

``` r
vertex.shapes(shape = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- shape:

  Character scalar, name of a vertex shape. If it is `NULL` for
  [`shapes()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/shapes.md), then the names
  of all defined vertex shapes are returned.
