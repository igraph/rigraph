# Neighborhood of graph vertices

These functions find the vertices not farther than a given limit from
another fixed vertex, these are called the neighborhood of the vertex.
Note that `ego()` and `neighborhood()`, `ego_size()` and
`neighborhood_size()`, `make_ego_graph()` and
`make_neighborhood()_graph()`, are synonyms (aliases).

## Usage

``` r
connect(graph, order, mode = c("all", "out", "in", "total"))

ego_size(
  graph,
  order = 1,
  nodes = V(graph),
  mode = c("all", "out", "in"),
  mindist = 0
)

neighborhood_size(
  graph,
  order = 1,
  nodes = V(graph),
  mode = c("all", "out", "in"),
  mindist = 0
)

ego(
  graph,
  order = 1,
  nodes = V(graph),
  mode = c("all", "out", "in"),
  mindist = 0
)

neighborhood(
  graph,
  order = 1,
  nodes = V(graph),
  mode = c("all", "out", "in"),
  mindist = 0
)

make_ego_graph(
  graph,
  order = 1,
  nodes = V(graph),
  mode = c("all", "out", "in"),
  mindist = 0
)

make_neighborhood_graph(
  graph,
  order = 1,
  nodes = V(graph),
  mode = c("all", "out", "in"),
  mindist = 0
)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph.

- order:

  Integer giving the order of the neighborhood. Negative values indicate
  an infinite order.

- mode:

  Character constant, it specifies how to use the direction of the edges
  if a directed graph is analyzed. For ‘out’ only the outgoing edges are
  followed, so all vertices reachable from the source vertex in at most
  `order` steps are counted. For ‘"in"’ all vertices from which the
  source vertex is reachable in at most `order` steps are counted.
  ‘"all"’ ignores the direction of the edges. This argument is ignored
  for undirected graphs.

- nodes:

  The vertices for which the calculation is performed.

- mindist:

  The minimum distance to include the vertex in the result.

## Value

- `ego_size()`/`neighborhood_size()` returns with an integer vector.

- `ego()`/`neighborhood()` (synonyms) returns A list of `igraph.vs` or a
  list of numeric vectors depending on the value of
  `igraph_opt("return.vs.es")`, see details for performance
  characteristics.

- `make_ego_graph()`/`make_neighborhood_graph()` returns with a list of
  graphs.

- `connect()` returns with a new graph object.

## Details

The neighborhood of a given order `r` of a vertex `v` includes all
vertices which are closer to `v` than the order. I.e. order 0 is always
`v` itself, order 1 is `v` plus its immediate neighbors, order 2 is
order 1 plus the immediate neighbors of the vertices in order 1, etc.

`ego_size()`/`neighborhood_size()` (synonyms) returns the size of the
neighborhoods of the given order, for each given vertex.

`ego()`/`neighborhood()` (synonyms) returns the vertices belonging to
the neighborhoods of the given order, for each given vertex.

`make_ego_graph()`/`make_neighborhood()_graph()` (synonyms) is creates
(sub)graphs from all neighborhoods of the given vertices with the given
order parameter. This function preserves the vertex, edge and graph
attributes.

`connect()` creates a new graph by connecting each vertex to all other
vertices in its neighborhood.
