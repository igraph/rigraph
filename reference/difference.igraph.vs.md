# Difference of vertex sequences

Difference of vertex sequences

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'igraph.vs'
difference(big, small, ...)
```

## Arguments

- big:

  The ‘big’ vertex sequence.

- small:

  The ‘small’ vertex sequence.

- ...:

  Ignored, included for S3 signature compatibility.

## Value

A vertex sequence that contains only vertices that are part of `big`,
but not part of `small`.

## Details

They must belong to the same graph. Note that this function has ‘set’
semantics and the multiplicity of vertices is lost in the result.
