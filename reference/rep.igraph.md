# Replicate a graph multiple times

The new graph will contain the input graph the given number of times, as
unconnected components.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'igraph'
rep(x, n, mark = TRUE, ...)

# S3 method for class 'igraph'
x * n
```

## Arguments

- x:

  The input graph.

- n:

  Number of times to replicate it.

- mark:

  Whether to mark the vertices with a `which` attribute, an integer
  number denoting which replication the vertex is coming from.

- ...:

  Additional arguments to satisfy S3 requirements, currently ignored.
