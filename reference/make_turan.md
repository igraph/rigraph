# Create a Tur치n graph

Tur치n graphs are complete multipartite graphs with the property that the
sizes of the partitions are as close to equal as possible.

## Usage

``` r
make_turan(n, r)

turan(...)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  Integer, the number of vertices in the graph.

- r:

  Integer, the number of partitions in the graph, must be positive.

- ...:

  Passed to `make_turan()`.

## Value

An igraph graph with a vertex attribute `type` storing the partition
index of each vertex. Partition indices start from 1.

## Details

The Tur치n graph with `n` vertices and `r` partitions is the densest
graph on `n` vertices that does not contain a clique of size `r+1`.

This function generates undirected graphs. The null graph is returned
when the number of vertices is zero. A complete graph is returned if the
number of partitions is greater than the number of vertices.

## Examples

``` r
# Create a Tur치n graph with 10 vertices and 3 partitions
g <- make_turan(10, 3)
plot(g)


# The sizes of the partitions are as balanced as possible
table(V(g)$type)
#> 
#> 1 2 3 
#> 4 3 3
