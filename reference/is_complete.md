# Is this a complete graph?

A graph is considered complete if there is an edge between all distinct
directed pairs of vertices. igraph considers both the singleton graph
and the null graph complete.

## Usage

``` r
is_complete(graph)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph.

## Value

True if the graph is complete.

g <- make_full_graph(6, directed = TRUE)
is_complete(g)
#> [1] TRUE
g <- delete_edges(g, 1)
is_complete(g)
#> [1] FALSE
g <- as_undirected(g)
is_complete(g)
#> [1] TRUE
