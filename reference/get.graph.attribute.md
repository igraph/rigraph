# Graph attributes of a graph

**\[deprecated\]**

`get.graph.attribute()` was renamed to
[`graph_attr()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/graph_attr.md) to create
a more consistent API.

## Usage

``` r
get.graph.attribute(graph, name)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  Input graph.

- name:

  The name of attribute to query. If missing, then all attributes are
  returned in a list.
