# Centralize a graph according to the degrees of vertices

See [`centralize()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/centralize.md) for a
summary of graph centralization.

## Usage

``` r
centr_degree(
  graph,
  mode = c("all", "out", "in", "total"),
  loops = TRUE,
  normalized = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  The input graph.

- mode:

  This is the same as the `mode` argument of
  [`degree()`](https://r.igraph.org/reference/degree.md).

- loops:

  Logical scalar, whether to consider loops edges when calculating the
  degree.

- normalized:

  Logical scalar. Whether to normalize the graph level centrality score
  by dividing by the theoretical maximum.

## Value

A named list with the following components:

- res:

  The node-level centrality scores.

- centralization:

  The graph level centrality index.

- theoretical_max:

  The maximum theoretical graph level centralization score for a graph
  with the given number of vertices, using the same parameters. If the
  `normalized` argument was `TRUE`, then the result was divided by this
  number.
