\title{Graph motifs}
\usage{
motifs(graph, size = 3, cut.prob = NULL, callback = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{Graph object, the input graph.}

\item{size}{The size of the motif, currently sizes 3 and 4 are supported in
directed graphs and sizes 3 to 6 in undirected graphs.}

\item{cut.prob}{Numeric vector giving the probabilities that the search
graph is cut at a certain level. Its length should be the same as the size
of the motif (the \code{size} argument).
If \code{NULL}, the default, no cuts are made.}

\item{callback}{Optional callback function to call for each motif found.
The function should accept two arguments: \code{vids} (integer vector of vertex IDs
in the motif) and \code{isoclass} (the isomorphism class of the motif).
The function should return \code{TRUE} to continue the search or \code{FALSE} to stop it.
If \code{NULL} (the default), motif counts are returned as a numeric vector.}
}
\value{
When \code{callback} is \code{NULL}, \code{motifs()} returns a numeric vector,
the number of occurrences of each motif in the graph. The motifs are ordered
by their isomorphism classes. Note that for unconnected subgraphs, which are
not considered to be motifs, the result will be \code{NA}.

When \code{callback} is provided, the function returns \code{NULL} invisibly and calls
the callback function for each motif found.
}
\description{
Graph motifs are small connected induced subgraphs with a well-defined
structure.  These functions search a graph for various motifs.
}
\details{
\code{motifs()} searches a graph for motifs of a given size and returns a
numeric vector containing the number of different motifs. The order of
the motifs is defined by their isomorphism class, see
\code{\link[=isomorphism_class]{isomorphism_class()}}.
}
\examples{
g <- sample_pa(100)
motifs(g, 3)
count_motifs(g, 3)
sample_motifs(g, 3)

# Using callback to stop search after finding 5 motifs
count <- 0
motifs(g, 3, callback = function(vids, isoclass) {
  count <<- count + 1
  count < 5  # stop after 5 motifs
})
