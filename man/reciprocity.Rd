}

\item{ignore.loops}{Logical constant, whether to ignore loop edges.}

\item{mode}{See below.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar between zero and one.
}
\description{
Calculates the reciprocity of a directed graph.
}
\details{
The measure of reciprocity defines the proportion of mutual connections, in
a directed graph. It is most commonly defined as the probability that the
opposite counterpart of a directed edge is also included in the graph. Or in
adjacency matrix notation:
\eqn{1 - \left(\sum_{i,j} |A_{ij} - A_{ji}|\right) / \left(2\sum_{i,j} A_{ij}\right)}{1 - (sum_ij |A_ij - A_ji|) / (2 sum_ij A_ij)}.
This measure is calculated if the \code{mode} argument is \code{default}.

Prior to igraph version 0.6, another measure was implemented, defined as the
probability of mutual connection between a vertex pair, if we know that
there is a (possibly non-mutual) connection between them. In other words,
(unordered) vertex pairs are classified into three groups: (1)
not-connected, (2) non-reciprocally connected, (3) reciprocally connected.
The result is the size of group (3), divided by the sum of group sizes
(2)+(3). This measure is calculated if \code{mode} is \code{ratio}.
