\title{Create a wheel graph}
\usage{
make_wheel(n, ..., mode = c("in", "out", "mutual", "undirected"), center = 1)

wheel(n, ..., mode = c("in", "out", "mutual", "undirected"), center = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of vertices.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{mode}{It defines the direction of the edges.
\verb{in}: the edges point \emph{to} the center, \code{out}: the edges point \emph{from} the
center, \code{mutual}: a directed wheel is created with mutual edges,
\code{undirected}: the edges are undirected.}

\item{center}{ID of the center vertex.}
}
\value{
An igraph graph.
}

A wheel graph is created by connecting a center vertex to all vertices of a
cycle graph.
A wheel graph on \code{n} vertices can be thought of as a wheel with \code{n - 1}
spokes.
The cycle graph part makes up the rim, while the star graph part adds the
spokes.

Note that the two and three-vertex wheel graphs are non-simple: The
two-vertex wheel graph contains a self-loop, while the three-vertex wheel
graph contains parallel edges (a 1-cycle and a 2-cycle, respectively).
