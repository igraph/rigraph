\title{Finding communities based on propagating labels}
\usage{
label.propagation.community(
  graph,
  weights = NULL,
  ...,
  mode = c("out", "in", "all"),
  initial = NULL,
  fixed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph. Note that the algorithm was originally
defined for undirected graphs. You are advised to set \sQuote{mode} to
\code{all} if you pass a directed graph here to treat it as
undirected.}

\item{weights}{The weights of the edges. It must be a positive numeric vector,
\code{NULL} or \code{NA}. If it is \code{NULL} and the input graph has a
\sQuote{weight} edge attribute, then that attribute will be used. If
\code{NULL} and no such attribute is present, then the edges will have equal
weights. Set this to \code{NA} if the graph was a \sQuote{weight} edge
attribute, but you don't want to use it for community detection. A larger
edge weight means a stronger connection for this function.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{mode}{Logical, whether to consider edge directions for the label propagation,
and if so, in which direction the labels should propagate. Ignored for undirected graphs.
"all" means to ignore edge directions (even in directed graphs).
"out" means to propagate labels along the natural direction of the edges.
"in" means to propagate labels backwards (i.e. from head to tail).}

\item{initial}{The initial state. If \code{NULL}, every vertex will have a
different label at the beginning. Otherwise it must be a vector with an
entry for each vertex. Non-negative values denote different labels, negative
entries denote vertices without labels.}

\item{fixed}{Logical vector denoting which labels are fixed. Of course this
makes sense only if you provided an initial state, otherwise this element
will be ignored. Also note that vertices without labels cannot be fixed.}
