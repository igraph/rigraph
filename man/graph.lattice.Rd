\title{Create a lattice graph}
\usage{
graph.lattice(
  dimvector = NULL,
  length = NULL,
  dim = NULL,
  nei = 1,
  directed = FALSE,
  mutual = FALSE,
  circular = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dimvector}{A vector giving the size of the lattice in each
dimension.}

\item{length}{Integer constant, for regular lattices, the size of the
lattice in each dimension.}

\item{dim}{Integer constant, the dimension of the lattice.}

\item{nei}{The distance within which (inclusive) the neighbors on the
lattice will be connected. This parameter is not used right now.}

\item{directed}{Whether to create a directed lattice.}

\item{mutual}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} directed lattices will be
mutually connected.}

\item{circular}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} the lattice or ring will be
circular.}

\code{graph.lattice()} was renamed to \code{make_lattice()} to create a more
consistent API.
