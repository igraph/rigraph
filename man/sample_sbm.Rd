\title{Sample stochastic block model}
\usage{
sample_sbm(n, pref.matrix, block.sizes, directed = FALSE, loops = FALSE)

sbm(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of vertices in the graph.}

\item{pref.matrix}{The matrix giving the Bernoulli rates.  This is a
\eqn{K\times K}{KxK} matrix, where \eqn{K} is the number of groups. The
probability of creating an edge between vertices from groups \eqn{i} and
\eqn{j} is given by element \eqn{(i,j)}. For undirected graphs, this matrix
must be symmetric.}

\item{block.sizes}{Numeric vector giving the number of vertices in each
group. The sum of the vector must match the number of vertices.}

\item{directed}{Logical scalar, whether to generate a directed graph.}

\item{loops}{Logical scalar, whether self-loops are allowed in the graph.}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{sample_sbm()}.}
}
\value{
An igraph graph.
}
\description{
Sampling from the stochastic block model of networks
}
\details{
This function samples graphs from a stochastic block model by (doing the
equivalent of) Bernoulli trials for each potential edge with the
probabilities given by the Bernoulli rate matrix, \code{pref.matrix}.
The order of the vertices in the generated graph corresponds to the
\code{block.sizes} argument.
}
\examples{

## Two groups with not only few connection between groups
pm <- cbind(c(.1, .001), c(.001, .05))
g <- sample_sbm(1000, pref.matrix = pm, block.sizes = c(300, 700))
g
