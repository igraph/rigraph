\title{Convert a general graph into a forest}
\usage{
unfold.tree(graph, mode = c("all", "out", "in", "total"), roots)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph, it can be either directed or undirected.}

\item{mode}{Character string, defined the types of the paths used for the
breadth-first search. \dQuote{out} follows the outgoing, \dQuote{in} the
incoming edges, \dQuote{all} and \dQuote{total} both of them. This argument
is ignored for undirected graphs.}

\item{roots}{A vector giving the vertices from which the breadth-first
