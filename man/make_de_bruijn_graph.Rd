\usage{
make_de_bruijn_graph(m, n)

de_bruijn_graph(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Integer scalar, the size of the alphabet. See details below.}

\item{n}{Integer scalar, the length of the labels. See details below.}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{make_de_bruijn_graph()}.}
}
\value{
A graph object.
}
\description{
De Bruijn graphs are labeled graphs representing the overlap of strings.
}
\details{
A de Bruijn graph represents relationships between strings. An alphabet of
\code{m} letters are used and strings of length \code{n} are considered.  A
vertex corresponds to every possible string and there is a directed edge
from vertex \code{v} to vertex \code{w} if the string of \code{v} can be
transformed into the string of \code{w} by removing its first letter and
appending a letter to it.

Please note that the graph will have \code{m} to the power \code{n} vertices
and even more edges, so probably you don't want to supply too big numbers
for \code{m} and \code{n}.

De Bruijn graphs have some interesting properties, please see another
source, e.g. Wikipedia for details.

# de Bruijn graphs can be created recursively by line graphs as well
g <- make_de_bruijn_graph(2, 1)
make_de_bruijn_graph(2, 2)
make_line_graph(g)
