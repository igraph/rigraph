\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of vertices.}

\item{power}{The power of the preferential attachment, the default is one,
i.e. linear preferential attachment.}

\item{m}{Numeric constant, the number of edges to add in each time step This
argument is only used if both \code{out.dist} and \code{out.seq} are omitted
or NULL.}

\item{out.dist}{Numeric vector, the distribution of the number of edges to
add in each time step. This argument is only used if the \code{out.seq}
argument is omitted or NULL.}

\item{out.seq}{Numeric vector giving the number of edges to add in each time
step. Its first element is ignored as no edges are added in the first time
step.}

\item{out.pref}{Logical, if true the total degree is used for calculating
the citation probability, otherwise the in-degree is used.}

\item{zero.appeal}{The \sQuote{attractiveness} of the vertices with no
adjacent edges. See details below.}

\item{directed}{Whether to create a directed graph.}

\item{algorithm}{The algorithm to use for the graph generation.
\code{psumtree} uses a partial prefix-sum tree to generate the graph, this
algorithm can handle any \code{power} and \code{zero.appeal} values and
never generates multiple edges.  \code{psumtree-multiple} also uses a
partial prefix-sum tree, but the generation of multiple edges is allowed.
Before the 0.6 version igraph used this algorithm if \code{power} was not
one, or \code{zero.appeal} was not one.  \code{bag} is the algorithm that
was previously (before version 0.6) used if \code{power} was one and
\code{zero.appeal} was one as well. It works by putting the ids of the
vertices into a bag (multiset, really), exactly as many times as their
(in-)degree, plus once more. Then the required number of cited vertices are
drawn from the bag, with replacement. This method might generate multiple
edges. It only works if \code{power} and \code{zero.appeal} are equal one.}

\item{start.graph}{\code{NULL} or an igraph graph. If a graph, then the
supplied graph is used as a starting graph for the preferential attachment
algorithm. The graph should have at least one vertex. If a graph is supplied
here and the \code{out.seq} argument is not \code{NULL}, then it should
contain the out degrees of the new vertices only, not the ones in the
\code{start.graph}.}
