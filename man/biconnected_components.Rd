\usage{
biconnected_components(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph. It is treated as an undirected graph, even if
it is directed.}
}
\value{
A named list with three components: \item{no}{Numeric scalar, an
integer giving the number of biconnected components in the graph.}
\item{tree_edges}{The components themselves, a list of numeric vectors. Each
vector is a set of edge ids giving the edges in a biconnected component.
These edges define a spanning tree of the component.}
\item{component_edges}{A list of numeric vectors. It gives all edges in the
components.} \item{components}{A list of numeric vectors, the vertices of
the components.} \item{articulation_points}{The articulation points of the
graph. See \code{\link[=articulation_points]{articulation_points()}}.}
}
\description{
Finding the biconnected components of a graph
}
\details{
A graph is biconnected if the removal of any single vertex (and its adjacent
edges) does not disconnect it.

A biconnected component of a graph is a maximal biconnected subgraph of it.
The biconnected components of a graph can be given by the partition of its
edges: every edge is a member of exactly one biconnected component. Note
that this is not true for vertices: the same vertex can be part of many
biconnected components.

\examples{

g <- disjoint_union(make_full_graph(5), make_full_graph(5))
clu <- components(g)$membership
g <- add_edges(g, c(which(clu == 1), which(clu == 2)))
bc <- biconnected_components(g)
