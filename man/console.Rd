\description{
The igraph console is a GUI windows that shows what the currently running
igraph function is doing.
}
\details{
The console can be started by calling the \code{console} function.
Then it stays open, until the user closes it.

Another way to start it to set the \code{verbose} igraph option to
\dQuote{tkconsole} via \code{igraph_options}. Then the console (re)opens
each time an igraph function supporting it starts; to close it, set the
\code{verbose} option to another value.

The console is written in Tcl/Tk and required the \code{tcltk} package.
