\title{Generate random graphs with a given degree sequence}
\usage{
degree.sequence.game(
  out.deg,
  in.deg = NULL,
  method = c("simple", "vl", "simple.no.multiple", "simple.no.multiple.uniform")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{out.deg}{Numeric vector, the sequence of degrees (for undirected
graphs) or out-degrees (for directed graphs). For undirected graphs its sum
should be even. For directed graphs its sum should be the same as the sum of
\code{in.deg}.}

\item{in.deg}{For directed graph, the in-degree sequence. By default this is
\code{NULL} and an undirected graph is created.}

\item{method}{Character, the method for generating the graph. See Details.}

\code{degree.sequence.game()} was renamed to \code{\link[=sample_degseq]{sample_degseq()}} to create a more
consistent API.
