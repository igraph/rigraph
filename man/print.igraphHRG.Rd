\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{igraphHRG} object to print.}

\item{type}{How to print the dendrogram, see details below.}

The hierarchical random graph model itself, invisibly.

\description{
\code{igraphHRG} objects can be printed to the screen in two forms: as
a tree or as a list, depending on the \code{type} argument of the
print function. By default the \code{auto} type is used, which selects
\code{tree} for small graphs and \code{simple} (=list) for bigger
ones. The \code{tree} format looks like
this: \preformatted{Hierarchical random graph, at level 3:
g1        p=   0
'- g15    p=0.33  1
   '- g13 p=0.88  6  3  9  4  2  10 7  5  8
'- g8     p= 0.5
   '- g16 p= 0.2  20 14 17 19 11 15 16 13
   '- g5  p=   0  12 18  }
This is a graph with 20 vertices, and the
top three levels of the fitted hierarchical random graph are
printed. The root node of the HRG is always vertex group #1
(\sQuote{\code{g1}} in the the printout). Vertex pairs in the left
subtree of \code{g1} connect to vertices in the right subtree with
probability zero, according to the fitted model. \code{g1} has two
subgroups, \code{g15} and \code{g8}. \code{g15} has a subgroup of a
single vertex (vertex 1), and another larger subgroup that contains
vertices 6, 3, etc. on lower levels, etc.
The \code{plain} printing is simpler and faster to produce, but less
visual: \preformatted{Hierarchical random graph:
g1  p=0.0 -> g12 g10   g2  p=1.0 -> 7 10      g3  p=1.0 -> g18 14
g4  p=1.0 -> g17 15    g5  p=0.4 -> g15 17    g6  p=0.0 -> 1 4
g7  p=1.0 -> 11 16     g8  p=0.1 -> g9 3      g9  p=0.3 -> g11 g16
g10 p=0.2 -> g4 g5     g11 p=1.0 -> g6 5      g12 p=0.8 -> g8 8
g13 p=0.0 -> g14 9     g14 p=1.0 -> 2 6       g15 p=0.2 -> g19 18
g16 p=1.0 -> g13 g2    g17 p=0.5 -> g7 13     g18 p=1.0 -> 12 19
g19 p=0.7 -> g3 20}
It lists the two subgroups of each internal node, in
as many columns as the screen width allows.
