\description{
This is an S3 generic function. See \code{methods("difference")}
for the actual implementations for various S3 classes. Initially
it is implemented for igraph graphs (difference of edges in two graphs),
and igraph vertex and edge sequences. See
\code{\link{difference.igraph}}, and
\code{\link{difference.igraph.vs}}.
