\title{Number of automorphisms}
\usage{
graph.automorphisms(graph, colors, sh = c("fm", "f", "fs", "fl", "flm", "fsm"))
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph, it is treated as undirected.}

\item{colors}{The colors of the individual vertices of the graph; only
vertices having the same color are allowed to match each other in an
automorphism. When omitted, igraph uses the \code{color} attribute of the
vertices, or, if there is no such vertex attribute, it simply assumes that
all vertices have the same color. Pass NULL explicitly if the graph has a
\code{color} vertex attribute but you do not want to use it.}

\item{sh}{The splitting heuristics for the BLISS algorithm. Possible values
are: \sQuote{\code{f}}: first non-singleton cell, \sQuote{\code{fl}}: first
largest non-singleton cell, \sQuote{\code{fs}}: first smallest non-singleton
cell, \sQuote{\code{fm}}: first maximally non-trivially connected
non-singleton cell, \sQuote{\code{flm}}: first largest maximally
non-trivially connected non-singleton cell, \sQuote{\code{fsm}}: first
smallest maximally non-trivially connected non-singleton cell.}

\code{graph.automorphisms()} was renamed to \code{count_automorphisms()} to create a more
consistent API.
