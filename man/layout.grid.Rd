\title{Simple grid layout}
\usage{
layout.grid(graph, width = 0, height = 0, dim = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{width}{The number of vertices in a single row of the grid. If this is
zero or negative, then for 2d layouts the width of the grid will be the
square root of the number of vertices in the graph, rounded up to the next
integer. Similarly, it will be the cube root for 3d layouts.}

\item{height}{The number of vertices in a single column of the grid, for
three dimensional layouts. If this is zero or negative, then it is
determinted automatically.}

\item{dim}{Two or three. Whether to make 2d or a 3d layout.}
