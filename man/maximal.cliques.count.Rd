\title{Functions to find cliques, i.e. complete subgraphs in a graph}
\usage{
maximal.cliques.count(graph, min = NULL, max = NULL, subset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph, directed graphs will be considered as
undirected ones, multiple edges and loops are ignored.}

\item{min}{Numeric constant, lower limit on the size of the cliques to find.
\code{NULL} means no limit, i.e. it is the same as 0.}

\item{max}{Numeric constant, upper limit on the size of the cliques to find.
\code{NULL} means no limit.}

\item{subset}{If not \code{NULL}, then it must be a vector of vertex ids,
numeric or symbolic if the graph is named. The algorithm is run from these
vertices only, so only a subset of all maximal cliques is returned. See the
Eppstein paper for details. This argument makes it possible to easily
parallelize the finding of maximal cliques.}

\code{maximal.cliques.count()} was renamed to \code{count_max_cliques()} to create a more
consistent API.
