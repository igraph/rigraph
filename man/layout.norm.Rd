\title{Normalize coordinates for plotting graphs}
\usage{
layout.norm(
  layout,
  xmin = -1,
  xmax = 1,
  ymin = -1,
  ymax = 1,
  zmin = -1,
  zmax = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{layout}{A matrix with two or three columns, the layout to normalize.}

\item{xmin, xmax}{The limits for the first coordinate, if one of them or both
are \code{NULL} then no normalization is performed along this direction.}

\item{ymin, ymax}{The limits for the second coordinate, if one of them or
both are \code{NULL} then no normalization is performed along this
direction.}

\item{zmin, zmax}{The limits for the third coordinate, if one of them or both
are \code{NULL} then no normalization is performed along this direction.}

\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}}

\code{layout.norm()} was renamed to \code{norm_coords()} to create a more
consistent API.
