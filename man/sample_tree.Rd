\title{Sample trees randomly and uniformly}
\usage{
sample_tree(n, directed = FALSE, method = c("lerw", "prufer"))
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of nodes in the tree}

\item{directed}{Whether to create a directed tree. The edges of the tree are
oriented away from the root.}

\item{method}{The algorithm to use to generate the tree. \sQuote{prufer}
samples Prufer sequences uniformly and then converts the sampled sequence to
a tree. \sQuote{lerw} performs a loop-erased random walk on the complete
graph to uniformly sampleits spanning trees. (This is also known as Wilson's
algorithm). The default is \sQuote{lerw}. Note that the method based on
Prufer sequences does not support directed trees at the moment.}
}
\value{
A graph object.
}
\description{
\code{sample_tree()} generates a random with a given number of nodes uniform
at random from the set of labelled trees.
}
\details{
In other words, the function generates each possible labelled tree with the
given number of nodes with the same probability.
}
\examples{

g <- sample_tree(100, method = "lerw")
