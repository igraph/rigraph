\title{Edges of a graph}
\usage{
E(graph, P = NULL, path = NULL, directed = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph.}

\item{P}{A list of vertices to select edges via pairs of vertices.
The first and second vertices select the first edge, the third
and fourth the second, etc.}

\item{path}{A list of vertices, to select edges along a path.
Note that this only works reliable for simple graphs. If the graph
has multiple edges, one of them will be chosen arbitrarily to
be included in the edge sequence.}

\item{directed}{Whether to consider edge directions in the \code{P}
argument, for directed graphs.}
}
\value{
An edge sequence of the graph.
}
\description{
An edge sequence is a vector containing numeric edge ids, with a special
class attribute that allows custom operations: selecting subsets of
edges based on attributes, or graph structure, creating the
intersection, union of edges, etc.
}
\details{
Edge sequences are usually used as igraph function arguments that
refer to edges of a graph.

An edge sequence is tied to the graph it refers to: it really denoted
the specific edges of that graph, and cannot be used together with
another graph.

An edge sequence is most often created by the \code{E()} function. The
result includes edges in increasing edge id order by default (if. none
of the \code{P} and \code{path} arguments are used). An edge
sequence can be indexed by a numeric vector, just like a regular R
vector. See links to other edge sequence operations below.
}
\section{Indexing edge sequences}{

Edge sequences mostly behave like regular vectors, but there are some
additional indexing operations that are specific for them;
e.g. selecting edges based on graph structure, or based on edge
attributes. See \code{\link{[.igraph.es}} for details.
}

\section{Querying or setting attributes}{

Edge sequences can be used to query or set attributes for the
edges in the sequence. See \code{\link[=$.igraph.es]{$.igraph.es()}} for details.

\examples{
# Edges of an unnamed graph
g <- make_ring(10)
E(g)

# Edges of a named graph
g2 <- make_ring(10) \%>\%
  set_vertex_attr("name", value = letters[1:10])
E(g2)
