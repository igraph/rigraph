\title{Creating a graph from LCF notation}
\usage{
graph_from_lcf(n, shifts, repeats = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer, the number of vertices in the graph.}

\item{shifts}{Integer vector, the shifts.}

\item{repeats}{Integer constant, how many times to repeat the shifts.}
}
\value{
A graph object.
}
\description{
LCF is short for Lederberg-Coxeter-Frucht, it is a concise notation for
3-regular Hamiltonian graphs. It constists of three parameters, the number
of vertices in the graph, a list of shifts giving additional edges to a
cycle backbone and another integer giving how many times the shifts should
be performed. See \url{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LCFNotation.html} for
details.

\examples{

# This is the Franklin graph:
g1 <- graph_from_lcf(12, c(5, -5), 6)
g2 <- make_graph("Franklin")
isomorphic(g1, g2)
}
\seealso{
\code{\link[=make_graph]{make_graph()}} can create arbitrary graphs, see also the other
functions on the its manual page for creating special graphs.
