\usage{
sample_bipartite_gnm(
  n1,
  n2,
  m,
  ...,
  directed = FALSE,
  mode = c("out", "in", "all")
)

sample_bipartite_gnp(

)
}
\arguments{
\item{n1}{Integer scalar, the number of bottom vertices.}

\item{n2}{Integer scalar, the number of top vertices.}

\item{m}{Integer scalar, the number of edges for \eqn{G(n,m)} graphs.}

\item{directed}{Logical scalar, whether to create a directed graph. See also
the \code{mode} argument.}

\item{mode}{Character scalar, specifies how to direct the edges in directed
graphs. If it is \sQuote{out}, then directed edges point from bottom
vertices to top vertices. If it is \sQuote{in}, edges point from top
vertices to bottom vertices. \sQuote{out} and \sQuote{in} do not generate
mutual edges. If this argument is \sQuote{all}, then each edge direction is
considered independently and mutual edges might be generated. This argument
is ignored for undirected graphs.}

\item{p}{Real scalar, connection probability for \eqn{G(n,p)} graphs.}

\item{type}{Character scalar, the type of the graph, \sQuote{gnp} creates a
\eqn{G(n,p)} graph, \sQuote{gnm} creates a \eqn{G(n,m)} graph. See details below.}

\description{
Generate bipartite graphs using the Erdős-Rényi model
}
\details{
Similarly to unipartite (one-mode) networks, we can define the \eqn{G(n,p)}, and
\eqn{G(n,m)} graph classes for bipartite graphs, via their generating process.
In \eqn{G(n,p)} every possible edge between top and bottom vertices is realized
with probability \eqn{p}, independently of the rest of the edges. In \eqn{G(n,m)}, we
uniformly choose \eqn{m} edges to realize.

## empty graph

## random bipartite graph
sample_bipartite_gnp(10, 5, p = .1)

## directed bipartite graph, G(n,m)
