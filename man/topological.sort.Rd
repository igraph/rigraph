\title{Topological sorting of vertices in a graph}
\usage{
topological.sort(graph, mode = c("out", "all", "in"))
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph, should be directed}

\item{mode}{Specifies how to use the direction of the edges.  For
\dQuote{\code{out}}, the sorting order ensures that each node comes before
all nodes to which it has edges, so nodes with no incoming edges go first.
For \dQuote{\verb{in}}, it is quite the opposite: each node comes before all
nodes from which it receives edges. Nodes with no outgoing edges go first.}

\code{topological.sort()} was renamed to \code{topo_sort()} to create a more
consistent API.
