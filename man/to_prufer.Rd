\title{Convert a tree graph to its Prufer sequence}
\usage{
to_prufer(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to convert to a Prufer sequence}
}
\value{
The Prufer sequence of the graph, represented as a numeric vector of
vertex IDs in the sequence.
}
\description{
\code{to_prufer()} converts a tree graph into its Prufer sequence.
}
\details{
The Prufer sequence of a tree graph with n labeled vertices is a sequence of
n-2 numbers, constructed as follows. If the graph has more than two vertices,
find a vertex with degree one, remove it from the tree and add the label of
the vertex that it was connected to to the sequence. Repeat until there are
only two vertices in the remaining graph.

g <- make_tree(13, 3)
