\usage{
estimate_closeness(
  graph,
  vids = V(graph),
  mode = c("out", "in", "all", "total"),
  cutoff,
  weights = NULL,
  normalized = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to analyze.}

\item{vids}{The vertices for which closeness will be calculated.}

\item{mode}{Character string, defined the types of the paths used for
measuring the distance in directed graphs. \dQuote{in} measures the paths
\emph{to} a vertex, \dQuote{out} measures paths \emph{from} a vertex,
\emph{all} uses undirected paths. This argument is ignored for undirected
graphs.}

\item{cutoff}{The maximum path length to consider when calculating the
closeness. If zero or negative then there is no such limit.}

\item{weights}{Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
closeness. If the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute, then this is
used by default. Weights are used for calculating weighted shortest
paths, so they are interpreted as distances.}

\item{normalized}{Logical scalar, whether to calculate the normalized
closeness, i.e. the inverse average distance to all reachable vertices.
The non-normalized closeness is the inverse of the sum of distances to
all reachable vertices.}

Use \code{\link[=closeness]{closeness()}} with the \code{cutoff} argument instead.
