\title{Centralize a graph according to the betweenness of vertices}
\usage{
centralization.betweenness(graph, directed = TRUE, normalized = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{directed}{logical scalar, whether to use directed shortest paths for
calculating betweenness.}

\item{normalized}{Logical scalar. Whether to normalize the graph level
centrality score by dividing by the theoretical maximum.}
