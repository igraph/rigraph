\title{Fit a hierarchical random graph model}
\usage{
hrg.fit(graph, hrg = NULL, start = FALSE, steps = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to fit the model to. Edge directions are ignored in
directed graphs.}

\item{hrg}{A hierarchical random graph model, in the form of an
\code{igraphHRG} object. \code{fit_hrg()} allows this to be \code{NULL}, in
which case a random starting point is used for the fitting.}

\item{start}{Logical, whether to start the fitting/sampling from the
supplied \code{igraphHRG} object, or from a random starting point.}

\item{steps}{The number of MCMC steps to make. If this is zero, then the
MCMC procedure is performed until convergence.}
