\usage{
laplacian_matrix(
  graph,
  weights = NULL,
  sparse = igraph_opt("sparsematrices"),
  normalization = c("unnormalized", "symmetric", "left", "right"),
  normalized
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{weights}{An optional vector giving edge weights for weighted Laplacian
matrix. If this is \code{NULL} and the graph has an edge attribute called
\code{weight}, then it will be used automatically. Set this to \code{NA} if
you want the unweighted Laplacian on a graph that has a \code{weight} edge
attribute.}

\item{sparse}{Logical scalar, whether to return the result as a sparse
matrix. The \code{Matrix} package is required for sparse matrices.}

\item{normalization}{The normalization method to use when calculating the
Laplacian matrix.}

\item{normalized}{Deprecated, use \code{normalization} instead.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix.
}
\description{
The Laplacian of a graph.
}
\details{
The Laplacian Matrix of a graph is a symmetric matrix having the same number
of rows and columns as the number of vertices in the graph and element (i,j)
is d[i], the degree of vertex i if if i==j, -1 if i!=j and there is an edge
between vertices i and j and 0 otherwise.

The Laplacian matrix can also be normalized, with several
conventional normalization methods. \dQuote{unnormalized} Unnormalized Laplacian.
\dQuote{symmetric} Symmetric normalized Laplacian. \dQuote{left} Left-stochastic normalized Laplacian.
\dQuote{right} Right-stochastic normalized Laplacian.

The weighted version of the Laplacian simply works with the weighted degree
instead of the plain degree. I.e. (i,j) is d[i], the weighted degree of
vertex i if if i==j, -w if i!=j and there is an edge between vertices i and
j with weight w, and 0 otherwise. The weighted degree of a vertex is the sum
of the weights of its adjacent edges.
