\title{Diameter of a graph}
\usage{
get.diameter(graph, directed = TRUE, unconnected = TRUE, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to analyze.}

\item{directed}{Logical, whether directed or undirected paths are to be
considered. This is ignored for undirected graphs.}

\item{unconnected}{Logical, what to do if the graph is unconnected. If
FALSE, the function will return a number that is one larger the largest
possible diameter, which is always the number of vertices. If TRUE, the
diameters of the connected components will be calculated and the largest one
will be returned.}

\item{weights}{Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
distances. If the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute, then this is
used by default.}

consistent API.
