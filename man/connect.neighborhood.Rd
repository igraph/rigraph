\title{Neighborhood of graph vertices}
\usage{
connect.neighborhood(graph, order, mode = c("all", "out", "in", "total"))
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{order}{Integer giving the order of the neighborhood.}

\item{mode}{Character constant, it specifies how to use the direction of
the edges if a directed graph is analyzed. For \sQuote{out} only the
outgoing edges are followed, so all vertices reachable from the source
vertex in at most \code{order} steps are counted. For \sQuote{"in"} all
vertices from which the source vertex is reachable in at most \code{order}
steps are counted. \sQuote{"all"} ignores the direction of the edges. This
argument is ignored for undirected graphs.}

\code{connect.neighborhood()} was renamed to \code{connect()} to create a more
consistent API.
