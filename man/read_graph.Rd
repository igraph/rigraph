\title{Reading foreign file formats}
\usage{
read_graph(
  file,
  format = c("edgelist", "pajek", "ncol", "lgl", "graphml", "dimacs", "graphdb", "gml",
    "dl"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The connection to read from. This can be a local file, or a
\code{http} or \code{ftp} connection. It can also be a character string with
the file name or URI.}

\item{format}{Character constant giving the file format. Right now
\code{edgelist}, \code{pajek}, \code{ncol}, \code{lgl}, \code{graphml}, 
\code{dimacs}, \code{graphdb}, \code{gml} and \code{dl} are supported, 
the default is \code{edgelist}. As of igraph 0.4 this argument is case 
insensitive.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments, see below.}
}
\value{
A graph object.
}
\description{
The \code{read_graph} function is able to read graphs in various
representations from a file, or from a http connection. Various formats 
are supported.
}
\details{
The \code{read_graph} function may have additional arguments depending on
the file format (the \code{format} argument). See the details separately for
each file format, below.
}
\section{Edge list format}{
 This format is a simple text file with numeric
vertex ids defining the edges. There is no need to have newline characters
between the edges, a simple space will also do.

Additional arguments: \describe{ \item{n}{The number of vertices in the
graph. If it is smaller than or equal to the largest integer in the file,
then it is ignored; so it is safe to set it to zero (the default).}
\item{directed}{Logical scalar, whether to create a directed graph. The
default value is \code{TRUE}.} }
