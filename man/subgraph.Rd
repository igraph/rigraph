\title{Subgraph of a graph}
\usage{
subgraph(graph, vids)

induced_subgraph(
  graph,
  vids,
  impl = c("auto", "copy_and_delete", "create_from_scratch")
)

subgraph_from_edges(graph, eids, delete.vertices = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The original graph.}

\item{vids}{Numeric vector, the vertices of the original graph which will
form the subgraph.}

\item{impl}{Character scalar, to choose between two implementation of the
subgraph calculation. \sQuote{\code{copy_and_delete}} copies the graph
first, and then deletes the vertices and edges that are not included in the
result graph. \sQuote{\code{create_from_scratch}} searches for all vertices
and edges that must be kept and then uses them to create the graph from
scratch. \sQuote{\code{auto}} chooses between the two implementations
automatically, using heuristics based on the size of the original and the
result graph.}

\item{eids}{The edge ids of the edges that will be kept in the result graph.}

\item{delete.vertices}{Logical scalar, whether to remove vertices that do
not have any adjacent edges in \code{eids}.}
}
\value{
A new graph object.
}
\description{
\code{subgraph()} creates a subgraph of a graph, containing only the specified
vertices and all the edges among them.
}
\details{
\code{induced_subgraph()} calculates the induced subgraph of a set of vertices
in a graph. This means that exactly the specified vertices and all the edges
between them will be kept in the result graph.

\code{subgraph_from_edges()} calculates the subgraph of a graph. For this function
one can specify the vertices and edges to keep. This function will be
renamed to \code{subgraph()} in the next major version of igraph.

The \code{subgraph()} function currently does the same as \code{induced_subgraph()}
(assuming \sQuote{\code{auto}} as the \code{impl} argument), but this behaviour
is deprecated. In the next major version, \code{subgraph()} will overtake the
functionality of \code{subgraph_from_edges()}.

g <- make_ring(10)
