\title{In- or out- component of a vertex}
\usage{
subcomponent(graph, v, mode = c("all", "out", "in"))
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to analyze.}

\item{v}{The vertex to start the search from.}

\item{mode}{Character string, either \dQuote{in}, \dQuote{out} or
\dQuote{all}. If \dQuote{in} all vertices from which \code{v} is reachable
are listed. If \dQuote{out} all vertices reachable from \code{v} are
returned. If \dQuote{all} returns the union of these. It is ignored for
undirected graphs.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector, the ids of the vertices in the same component as
\code{v}.
}
\description{
Finds all vertices reachable from a given vertex, or the opposite: all
vertices from which a given vertex is reachable via a directed path.
}
\details{
A breadth-first search is conducted starting from vertex \code{v}.
}
\examples{

g <- sample_gnp(100, 1 / 200)
subcomponent(g, 1, "in")
subcomponent(g, 1, "out")
subcomponent(g, 1, "all")
