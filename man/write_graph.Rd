\title{Writing the graph to a file in some format}
\usage{
write_graph(
  graph,
  file,
  format = c("edgelist", "pajek", "ncol", "lgl", "graphml", "dimacs", "gml", "dot",
    "leda"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to export.}

\item{file}{A connection or a string giving the file name to write the graph
to.}

\item{format}{Character string giving the file format. Right now
\code{pajek}, \code{graphml}, \code{dot}, \code{gml}, \code{edgelist},
\code{lgl}, \code{ncol}, \code{leda} and \code{dimacs} are implemented. As of igraph 0.4
this argument is case insensitive.}

\item{\dots}{Other, format specific arguments, see below.}
}
\value{
A `NULL``, invisibly.
}
\description{
\code{write_graph()} is a general function for exporting graphs to foreign
file formats. The recommended formats for data exchange are GraphML and GML.
}
\section{Edge list format}{
 The \code{edgelist} format is a simple text file,
with one edge per line, the two zero-based numerical vertex IDs separated
by a space character. Note that vertices are indexed starting with zero.
The file is sorted by the first and the second column. This format has no
additional arguments.
}

\section{NCOL format}{
 This format is a plain text edge list in which vertices
are referred to by name rather than numerical ID. Edge weights may be
optionally written. Additional parameters:
\describe{
\item{names}{The name of a vertex attribute to take vertex names from or
\code{NULL} to use zero-based numerical IDs.}
\item{weights}{The name of an edge attribute to take edge weights from or
\code{NULL} to omit edge weights.}
}
}

\section{Pajek format}{
 The \code{pajek} format is provided for interoperability
with the Pajek software only. Since the format does not have a formal
specification, it is not recommended for general data exchange or archival.
}

\examples{

g <- make_ring(10)
file <- tempfile(fileext = ".txt")
write_graph(g, file, "edgelist")
if (!interactive()) {
  unlink(file)
