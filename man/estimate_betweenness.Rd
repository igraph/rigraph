\title{Deprecated version of \code{betweenness()}}
\usage{
estimate_betweenness(
  graph,
  vids = V(graph),
  directed = TRUE,
  cutoff,
  weights = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to analyze.}

\item{vids}{The vertices for which the vertex betweenness estimation will be
calculated.}

\item{directed}{Logical, whether directed paths should be considered while
determining the shortest paths.}

\item{cutoff}{The maximum shortest path length to consider when calculating
betweenness. If negative, then there is no such limit.}

\item{weights}{Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
betweenness. If the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute, then this is
used by default. Weights are used to calculate weighted shortest paths,
so they are interpreted as distances.}
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}}

Use \code{\link[=betweenness]{betweenness()}} with the \code{cutoff} argument instead.
