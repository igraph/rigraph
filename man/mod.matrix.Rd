\title{Modularity of a community structure of a graph}
\usage{
mod.matrix(graph, membership, weights = NULL, resolution = 1, directed = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{membership}{Numeric vector, one value for each vertex, the membership
vector of the community structure.}

\item{weights}{If not \code{NULL} then a numeric vector giving edge weights.}

\item{resolution}{The resolution parameter. Must be greater than or equal to
0. Set it to 1 to use the classical definition of modularity.}

\item{directed}{Whether to use the directed or undirected version of
modularity. Ignored for undirected graphs.}
