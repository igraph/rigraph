\usage{
cluster_edge_betweenness(
  graph,
  weights = E(graph)$weight,
  directed = TRUE,
  edge.betweenness = TRUE,
  merges = TRUE,
  bridges = TRUE,
  modularity = TRUE,
  membership = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to analyze.}

\item{weights}{The edge weights. Supply \code{NULL} to omit edge weights. By
default the \sQuote{\code{weight}} edge attribute is used, if it is present.
Edge weights are used to calculate weighted edge betweenness. This means
that edges are interpreted as distances, not as connection strengths.}

\item{directed}{Logical constant, whether to calculate directed edge
betweenness for directed graphs. It is ignored for undirected graphs.}

\item{edge.betweenness}{Logical constant, whether to return the edge
betweenness of the edges at the time of their removal.}

\item{merges}{Logical constant, whether to return the merge matrix
representing the hierarchical community structure of the network.  This
argument is called \code{merges}, even if the community structure algorithm
itself is divisive and not agglomerative: it builds the tree from top to
bottom. There is one line for each merge (i.e. split) in matrix, the first
line is the first merge (last split). The communities are identified by
integer number starting from one. Community ids smaller than or equal to
\eqn{N}, the number of vertices in the graph, belong to singleton
communities, ie. individual vertices. Before the first merge we have \eqn{N}
communities numbered from one to \eqn{N}. The first merge, the first line of
the matrix creates community \eqn{N+1}, the second merge creates community
\eqn{N+2}, etc.}

\item{bridges}{Logical constant, whether to return a list the edge removals
which actually splitted a component of the graph.}

\item{modularity}{Logical constant, whether to calculate the maximum
modularity score, considering all possibly community structures along the
edge-betweenness based edge removals.}

\item{membership}{Logical constant, whether to calculate the membership
vector corresponding to the highest possible modularity score.}

\description{
Many networks consist of modules which are densely connected themselves but
sparsely connected to other modules.
}
\details{
The edge betweenness score of an edge measures the number of shortest paths
through it, see \code{\link{edge_betweenness}} for details. The idea of the
edge betweenness based community structure detection is that it is likely
that edges connecting separate modules have high edge betweenness as all the
shortest paths from one module to another must traverse through them. So if
we gradually remove the edge with the highest edge betweenness score we will
get a hierarchical map, a rooted tree, called a dendrogram of the graph. The
leafs of the tree are the individual vertices and the root of the tree
represents the whole graph.

\code{cluster_edge_betweenness} performs this algorithm by calculating the
edge betweenness of the graph, removing the edge with the highest edge
betweenness score, then recalculating edge betweenness of the edges and
again removing the one with the highest score, etc.

\code{edge.betweeness.community} returns various information collected
through the run of the algorithm. See the return value down here.
