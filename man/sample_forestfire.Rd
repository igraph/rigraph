\title{Forest Fire Network Model}
\usage{
sample_forestfire(nodes, fw.prob, bw.factor = 1, ambs = 1, directed = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{The number of vertices in the graph.}

\item{fw.prob}{The forward burning probability, see details below.}

\item{bw.factor}{The backward burning ratio. The backward burning
probability is calculated as \code{bw.factor*fw.prob}.}

\item{ambs}{The number of ambassador vertices.}

\item{directed}{Logical scalar, whether to create a directed graph.}
}
\value{
A simple graph, possibly directed if the \code{directed} argument is
\code{TRUE}.
}
\description{
This is a growing network model, which resembles of how the forest fire
spreads by igniting trees close by.
}
\details{
The forest fire model intends to reproduce the following network
characteristics, observed in real networks: \itemize{ \item Heavy-tailed
in-degree distribution.  \item Heavy-tailed out-degree distribution.  \item
Communities.  \item Densification power-law. The network is densifying in
time, according to a power-law rule.  \item Shrinking diameter. The diameter
of the network decreases in time.  }

The network is generated in the following way. One vertex is added at a
time. This vertex connects to (cites) \code{ambs} vertices already present
in the network, chosen uniformly random. Now, for each cited vertex \eqn{v}
we do the following procedure: \enumerate{ \item We generate two random
number, \eqn{x} and \eqn{y}, that are geometrically distributed with means
\eqn{p/(1-p)} and \eqn{rp(1-rp)}. (\eqn{p} is \code{fw.prob}, \eqn{r} is
\code{bw.factor}.) The new vertex cites \eqn{x} outgoing neighbors and
\eqn{y} incoming neighbors of \eqn{v}, from those which are not yet cited by
the new vertex. If there are less than \eqn{x} or \eqn{y} such vertices
available then we cite all of them.  \item The same procedure is applied to
all the newly cited vertices.  }
}
\note{
The version of the model in the published paper is incorrect in the
sense that it cannot generate the kind of graphs the authors claim. A
corrected version is available from
\url{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/pubs/powergrowth-tkdd.pdf}, our
implementation is based on this.

\examples{

fire <- sample_forestfire(50, fw.prob = 0.37, bw.factor = 0.32 / 0.37)
plot(fire)

g <- sample_forestfire(10000, fw.prob = 0.37, bw.factor = 0.32 / 0.37)
dd1 <- degree_distribution(g, mode = "in")
dd2 <- degree_distribution(g, mode = "out")
# The forest fire model produces graphs with a heavy tail degree distribution.
# Note that some in- or out-degrees are zero which will be excluded from the logarithmic plot.
plot(seq(along.with = dd1) - 1, dd1, log = "xy")
points(seq(along.with = dd2) - 1, dd2, col = 2, pch = 2)
