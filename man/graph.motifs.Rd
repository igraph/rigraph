\usage{
graph.motifs(graph, size = 3, cut.prob = rep(0, size))
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{Graph object, the input graph.}

\item{size}{The size of the motif, currently sizes 3 and 4 are supported in
directed graphs and sizes 3-6 in undirected graphs.}

\item{cut.prob}{Numeric vector giving the probabilities that the search
graph is cut at a certain level. Its length should be the same as the size
of the motif (the \code{size} argument). By default no cuts are made.}
