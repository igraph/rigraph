\title{Optimal community structure}
\usage{
optimal.community(graph, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph. Edge directions are ignored for directed
graphs.}

\item{weights}{The weights of the edges. It must be a positive numeric vector,
\code{NULL} or \code{NA}. If it is \code{NULL} and the input graph has a
\sQuote{weight} edge attribute, then that attribute will be used. If
\code{NULL} and no such attribute is present, then the edges will have equal
weights. Set this to \code{NA} if the graph was a \sQuote{weight} edge
attribute, but you don't want to use it for community detection. A larger
edge weight means a stronger connection for this function.}
