\title{Fit a hierarchical random graph model}
\usage{
fit_hrg(graph, hrg = NULL, start = FALSE, steps = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to fit the model to. Edge directions are ignored in
directed graphs.}

\item{hrg}{A hierarchical random graph model, in the form of an
\code{igraphHRG} object. \code{fit_hrg()} allows this to be \code{NULL}, in
which case a random starting point is used for the fitting.}

\item{start}{Logical, whether to start the fitting/sampling from the
supplied \code{igraphHRG} object, or from a random starting point.}

\item{steps}{The number of MCMC steps to make. If this is zero, then the
MCMC procedure is performed until convergence.}
}
\value{
\code{fit_hrg()} returns an \code{igraphHRG} object. This is a list
with the following members:
\item{left}{Vector that contains the left children of the internal
tree vertices. The first vertex is always the root vertex, so the
first element of the vector is the left child of the root
vertex. Internal vertices are denoted with negative numbers, starting
from -1 and going down, i.e. the root vertex is -1. Leaf vertices
are denoted by non-negative number, starting from zero and up.}
\item{right}{Vector that contains the right children of the vertices,
with the same encoding as the \code{left} vector.}
\item{prob}{The connection probabilities attached to the internal
vertices, the first number belongs to the root vertex (i.e. internal
vertex -1), the second to internal vertex -2, etc.}
\item{edges}{The number of edges in the subtree below the given
internal vertex.}
\item{vertices}{The number of vertices in the subtree below the
given internal vertex, including itself.}
}
\description{
\code{fit_hrg()} fits a HRG to a given graph. It takes the specified
\code{steps} number of MCMC steps to perform the fitting, or a convergence
criteria if the specified number of steps is zero. \code{fit_hrg()} can start
from a given HRG, if this is given in the \code{hrg()} argument and the
\code{start} argument is \code{TRUE}. It can be converted to the \code{hclust} class using
\code{as.hclust()} provided in this package.
