\title{Shortest (directed or undirected) paths between vertices}
\usage{
average.path.length(
  graph,
  weights = NULL,
  directed = TRUE,
  unconnected = TRUE,
  details = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to work on.}

\item{weights}{Possibly a numeric vector giving edge weights. If this is
\code{NULL} and the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute, then the
attribute is used. If this is \code{NA} then no weights are used (even if
the graph has a \code{weight} attribute). In a weighted graph, the length
of a path is the sum of the weights of its constituent edges.}

\item{directed}{Whether to consider directed paths in directed graphs,
this argument is ignored for undirected graphs.}

\item{unconnected}{What to do if the graph is unconnected (not
strongly connected if directed paths are considered). If TRUE, only
the lengths of the existing paths are considered and averaged; if
FALSE, the length of the missing paths are considered as having infinite
length, making the mean distance infinite as well.}

\item{details}{Whether to provide additional details in the result.
Functions accepting this argument (like \code{mean_distance()}) return
additional information like the number of disconnected vertex pairs in
the result when this parameter is set to \code{TRUE}.}

\code{average.path.length()} was renamed to \code{mean_distance()} to create a more
consistent API.
