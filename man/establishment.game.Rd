\title{Graph generation based on different vertex types}
\usage{
establishment.game(
  nodes,
  types,
  k = 1,
  type.dist = rep(1, types),
  pref.matrix = matrix(1, types, types),
  directed = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{The number of vertices in the graph.}

\item{types}{The number of different vertex types.}

\item{k}{The number of trials per time step, see details below.}

\item{type.dist}{The distribution of the vertex types. This is assumed to be
stationary in time.}

\item{pref.matrix}{A matrix giving the preferences of the given vertex
types. These should be probabilities, i.e. numbers between zero and one.}

\item{directed}{Logical constant, whether to generate directed graphs.}
