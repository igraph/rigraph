\title{Independent vertex sets}
\usage{
ivs(graph, min = NULL, max = NULL)

largest_ivs(graph)

max_ivs(graph)

ivs_size(graph)

independence_number(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph, directed graphs are considered as undirected,
loop edges and multiple edges are ignored.}

\item{min}{Numeric constant, limit for the minimum size of the independent
vertex sets to find. \code{NULL} means no limit.}

\item{max}{Numeric constant, limit for the maximum size of the independent
vertex sets to find. \code{NULL} means no limit.}
}
\value{
\code{ivs()},
\code{largest_ivs()} and
\code{max_ivs()} return a list containing numeric
vertex ids, each list element is an independent vertex set.

\code{ivs_size()} returns an integer constant.
}
\description{
A vertex set is called independent if there no edges between any two
vertices in it. These functions find independent vertex sets in undirected
graphs
}
\details{
\code{ivs()} finds all independent vertex sets in the
network, obeying the size limitations given in the \code{min} and \code{max}
arguments.

\code{largest_ivs()} finds the largest independent vertex
sets in the graph. An independent vertex set is largest if there is no
independent vertex set with more vertices.

\code{max_ivs()} finds the maximal independent vertex
sets in the graph. An independent vertex set is maximal if it cannot be
extended to a larger independent vertex set. The largest independent vertex
sets are maximal, but the opposite is not always true.

\code{ivs_size()} calculate the size of the largest independent
vertex set(s).

\code{independence_number()} is an alias for \code{ivs_size()}.

These functions use the algorithm described by Tsukiyama et al., see
reference below.

# Do not run, takes a couple of seconds

# A quite dense graph
set.seed(42)
g <- sample_gnp(100, 0.9)
ivs_size(g)
ivs(g, min = ivs_size(g))
largest_ivs(g)
# Empty graph
