\title{Random graphs from vertex fitness scores}
\usage{
static.fitness.game(
  no.of.edges,
  fitness.out,
  fitness.in = NULL,
  loops = FALSE,
  multiple = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{no.of.edges}{The number of edges in the generated graph.}

\item{fitness.out}{A numeric vector containing the fitness of each vertex.
For directed graphs, this specifies the out-fitness of each vertex.}

\item{fitness.in}{If \code{NULL} (the default), the generated graph will be
undirected. If not \code{NULL}, then it should be a numeric vector and it
specifies the in-fitness of each vertex.

If this argument is not \code{NULL}, then a directed graph is generated,
otherwise an undirected one.}

\item{loops}{Logical scalar, whether to allow loop edges in the graph.}

\item{multiple}{Logical scalar, whether to allow multiple edges in the
graph.}
