\usage{
exportPajek(blocks, graph, file, project.file = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{For \code{cohesive_blocks()} a graph object of class
\code{igraph}. It must be undirected and simple. (See
\code{\link[=is_simple]{is_simple()}}.)

For \code{graphs_from_cohesive_blocks()} and \code{export_pajek()} the same graph must be
supplied whose cohesive block structure is given in the \code{blocks()}
argument.}

\item{file}{Defines the file (or connection) the Pajek file is written to.

If the \code{project.file} argument is \code{TRUE}, then it can be a
filename (with extension), a file object, or in general any king of
connection object. The file/connection will be opened if it wasn't already.

If the \code{project.file} argument is \code{FALSE}, then several files are
created and \code{file} must be a character scalar containing the base name
of the files, without extension. (But it can contain the path to the files.)

See also details below.}

\item{project.file}{Logical scalar, whether to create a single Pajek project
file containing all the data, or to create separated files for each item.
See details below.}
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}}

\code{exportPajek()} was renamed to \code{export_pajek()} to create a more
consistent API.
