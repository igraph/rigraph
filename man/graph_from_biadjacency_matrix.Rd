\title{Create graphs from a bipartite adjacency matrix}
\usage{
graph_from_biadjacency_matrix(
  incidence,
  directed = FALSE,
  mode = c("all", "out", "in", "total"),
  multiple = FALSE,
  weighted = NULL,
  add.names = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{The input bipartite adjacency matrix. It can also be a sparse matrix
from the \code{Matrix} package.}

\item{directed}{Logical scalar, whether to create a directed graph.}

\item{mode}{A character constant, defines the direction of the edges in
directed graphs, ignored for undirected graphs. If \sQuote{\code{out}}, then
edges go from vertices of the first kind (corresponding to rows in the
bipartite adjacency matrix) to vertices of the second kind (columns in the incidence
matrix). If \sQuote{\verb{in}}, then the opposite direction is used. If
\sQuote{\code{all}} or \sQuote{\code{total}}, then mutual edges are created.}

\item{multiple}{Logical scalar, specifies how to interpret the matrix
elements. See details below.}

\item{weighted}{This argument specifies whether to create a weighted graph
from the bipartite adjacency matrix. If it is \code{NULL} then an unweighted graph is
created and the \code{multiple} argument is used to determine the edges of
the graph. If it is a character constant then for every non-zero matrix
entry an edge is created and the value of the entry is added as an edge
attribute named by the \code{weighted} argument. If it is \code{TRUE} then a
weighted graph is created and the name of the edge attribute will be
\sQuote{\code{weight}}.}

\item{add.names}{A character constant, \code{NA} or \code{NULL}.
\code{graph_from_biadjacency_matrix()} can add the row and column names of the incidence
matrix as vertex attributes. If this argument is \code{NULL} (the default)
and the bipartite adjacency matrix has both row and column names, then these are added
as the \sQuote{\code{name}} vertex attribute. If you want a different vertex
attribute for this, then give the name of the attributes as a character
string. If this argument is \code{NA}, then no vertex attributes (other than
type) will be added.}
}
\value{
A bipartite igraph graph. In other words, an igraph graph that has a
vertex attribute \code{type}.
}
\description{
\code{graph_from_biadjacency_matrix()} creates a bipartite igraph graph from an incidence
matrix.
}
\details{
Bipartite graphs have a \sQuote{\code{type}} vertex attribute in igraph,
this is boolean and \code{FALSE} for the vertices of the first kind and
\code{TRUE} for vertices of the second kind.

\code{graph_from_biadjacency_matrix()} can operate in two modes, depending on the
\code{multiple} argument. If it is \code{FALSE} then a single edge is
created for every non-zero element in the bipartite adjacency matrix. If
\code{multiple} is \code{TRUE}, then the matrix elements are rounded up to
the closest non-negative integer to get the number of edges to create
between a pair of vertices.

Some authors refer to the bipartite adjacency matrix as the
"bipartite incidence matrix". igraph 1.6.0 and later does not use
this naming to avoid confusion with the edge-vertex incidence matrix.
