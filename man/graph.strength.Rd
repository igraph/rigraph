\title{Strength or weighted vertex degree}
\usage{
graph.strength(
  graph,
  vids = V(graph),
  mode = c("all", "out", "in", "total"),
  loops = TRUE,
  weights = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{vids}{The vertices for which the strength will be calculated.}

\item{mode}{Character string, \dQuote{out} for out-degree, \dQuote{in} for
in-degree or \dQuote{all} for the sum of the two. For undirected graphs this
argument is ignored.}

\item{loops}{Logical; whether the loop edges are also counted.}

\item{weights}{Weight vector. If the graph has a \code{weight} edge
attribute, then this is used by default. If the graph does not have a
\code{weight} edge attribute and this argument is \code{NULL}, then a
\code{\link[=degree]{degree()}} is called. If this is \code{NA}, then no edge weights are used
(even if the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute).}

\code{graph.strength()} was renamed to \code{strength()} to create a more
consistent API.
