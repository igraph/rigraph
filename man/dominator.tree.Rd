\usage{
dominator.tree(graph, root, mode = c("out", "in", "all", "total"))
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A directed graph. If it is not a flowgraph, and it contains
some vertices not reachable from the root vertex, then these vertices will
be collected and returned as part of the result.}

\item{root}{The id of the root (or source) vertex, this will be the root of
the tree.}

\item{mode}{Constant, must be \sQuote{\verb{in}} or \sQuote{\code{out}}. If
it is \sQuote{\verb{in}}, then all directions are considered as opposite to
the original one in the input graph.}
