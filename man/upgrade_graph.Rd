\arguments{

\description{
igraph's internal data representation changes sometimes between
versions. This means that it is not possible to use igraph objects
that were created (and possibly saved to a file) with an older
igraph version.
}
\details{
\code{\link[=graph_version]{graph_version()}} queries the current data format,
or the data format of a possibly older igraph graph.

\code{upgrade_graph()} can convert an older data format
to the current one.
}
\seealso{
graph_version to check the current data format version
or the version of a graph.

Other versions: 
\code{\link{graph_version}()}
