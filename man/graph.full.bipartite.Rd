\title{Create a full bipartite graph}
\usage{
graph.full.bipartite(n1, n2, directed = FALSE, mode = c("all", "out", "in"))
}
\arguments{
\item{n1}{The number of vertices of the first kind.}

\item{n2}{The number of vertices of the second kind.}

\item{directed}{Logical scalar, whether the graphs is directed.}

\item{mode}{Scalar giving the kind of edges to create for directed graphs.
If this is \sQuote{\code{out}} then all vertices of the first kind are
connected to the others; \sQuote{\verb{in}} specifies the opposite
direction; \sQuote{\code{all}} creates mutual edges. This argument is
ignored for undirected graphs.x}
