\usage{
assortativity.nominal(graph, types, directed = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph, it can be directed or undirected.}

\item{types}{Vector giving the vertex types. They as assumed to be integer
numbers, starting with one. Non-integer values are converted to integers
with \code{\link[=as.integer]{as.integer()}}.}

\item{directed}{Logical scalar, whether to consider edge directions for
directed graphs.
This argument is ignored for undirected graphs.
Supply
\code{TRUE} here to do the natural thing, i.e. use directed version of the
measure for directed graphs and the undirected version for undirected
graphs.}
