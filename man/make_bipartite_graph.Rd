\title{Create a bipartite graph}
\usage{
make_bipartite_graph(types, edges, directed = FALSE)

bipartite_graph(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{types}{A vector giving the vertex types. It will be coerced into
boolean. The length of the vector gives the number of vertices in the graph.
When the vector is a named vector, the names will be attached to the graph
as the \code{name} vertex attribute.}

\item{edges}{A vector giving the edges of the graph, the same way as for the
regular \code{\link[=make_graph]{make_graph()}} function. It is checked that the edges indeed
connect vertices of different kind, according to the supplied \code{types}
vector. The vector may be a string vector if \code{types} is a named vector.}

\item{directed}{Whether to create a directed graph, boolean constant. Note
that by default undirected graphs are created, as this is more common for
bipartite graphs.}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{make_bipartite_graph()}.}
}
\value{
\code{make_bipartite_graph()} returns a bipartite igraph graph. In other
words, an igraph graph that has a vertex attribute named \code{type}.

\code{is_bipartite()} returns a logical scalar.
}
\description{
A bipartite graph has two kinds of vertices and connections are only allowed
between different kinds.
}
\details{
Bipartite graphs have a \code{type} vertex attribute in igraph, this is
boolean and \code{FALSE} for the vertices of the first kind and \code{TRUE}
for vertices of the second kind.

\code{make_bipartite_graph()} basically does three things. First it checks the
\code{edges} vector against the vertex \code{types}. Then it creates a graph
using the \code{edges} vector and finally it adds the \code{types} vector as
a vertex attribute called \code{type}. \code{edges} may contain strings as
vertex names; in this case, \code{types} must be a named vector that specifies
the type for each vertex name that occurs in \code{edges}.
