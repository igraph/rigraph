\title{Create graphs from adjacency matrices}
\usage{
graph.adjacency(
  adjmatrix,
  mode = c("directed", "undirected", "max", "min", "upper", "lower", "plus"),
  weighted = NULL,
  diag = TRUE,
  add.colnames = NULL,
  add.rownames = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{adjmatrix}{A square adjacency matrix. From igraph version 0.5.1 this
can be a sparse matrix created with the \code{Matrix} package.}

\item{mode}{Character scalar, specifies how igraph should interpret the
supplied matrix. See also the \code{weighted} argument, the interpretation
depends on that too. Possible values are: \code{directed},
\code{undirected}, \code{upper}, \code{lower}, \code{max}, \code{min},
\code{plus}. See details below.}

\item{weighted}{This argument specifies whether to create a weighted graph
from an adjacency matrix. If it is \code{NULL} then an unweighted graph is
created and the elements of the adjacency matrix gives the number of edges
between the vertices. If it is a character constant then for every non-zero
matrix entry an edge is created and the value of the entry is added as an
edge attribute named by the \code{weighted} argument. If it is \code{TRUE}
then a weighted graph is created and the name of the edge attribute will be
\code{weight}. See also details below.}

\item{diag}{Logical scalar, whether to include the diagonal of the matrix in
the calculation. If this is \code{FALSE} then the diagonal is zerod out
first.}

\item{add.colnames}{Character scalar, whether to add the column names as
vertex attributes. If it is \sQuote{\code{NULL}} (the default) then, if
present, column names are added as vertex attribute \sQuote{name}. If
\sQuote{\code{NA}} then they will not be added.  If a character constant,
then it gives the name of the vertex attribute to add.}

\item{add.rownames}{Character scalar, whether to add the row names as vertex
attributes. Possible values the same as the previous argument. By default
row names are not added. If \sQuote{\code{add.rownames}} and
\sQuote{\code{add.colnames}} specify the same vertex attribute, then the
former is ignored.}

\code{graph.adjacency()} was renamed to \code{\link[=graph_from_adjacency_matrix]{graph_from_adjacency_matrix()}} to create a more
consistent API.
