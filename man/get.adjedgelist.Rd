\usage{
get.adjedgelist(
  graph,
  mode = c("all", "out", "in", "total"),
  loops = c("twice", "once", "ignore")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{mode}{Character scalar, it gives what kind of adjacent edges/vertices
to include in the lists. \sQuote{\code{out}} is for outgoing edges/vertices,
\sQuote{\verb{in}} is for incoming edges/vertices, \sQuote{\code{all}} is
for both. This argument is ignored for undirected graphs.}

\item{loops}{Character scalar, one of \code{"ignore"} (to omit loops), \code{"twice"}
(to include loop edges twice) and \code{"once"} (to include them once). \code{"twice"}
is not allowed for directed graphs and will be replaced with \code{"once"}.}

\code{get.adjedgelist()} was renamed to \code{\link[=as_adj_edge_list]{as_adj_edge_list()}} to create a more
