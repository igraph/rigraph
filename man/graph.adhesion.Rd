\title{Edge connectivity}
\usage{
graph.adhesion(graph, checks = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{checks}{Logical constant. Whether to check that the graph is connected
and also the degree of the vertices. If the graph is not (strongly)
connected then the connectivity is obviously zero. Otherwise if the minimum
degree is one then the edge connectivity is also one. It is a good idea to
perform these checks, as they can be done quickly compared to the
connectivity calculation itself.  They were suggested by Peter McMahan,
thanks Peter.}
