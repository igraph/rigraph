graph.coreness(graph, mode = c("all", "out", "in"))
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph, it can be directed or undirected}

\item{mode}{The type of the core in directed graphs. Character constant,
possible values: \verb{in}: in-cores are computed, \code{out}: out-cores are
computed, \code{all}: the corresponding undirected graph is considered. This
argument is ignored for undirected graphs.}
