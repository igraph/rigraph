\section{\sQuote{auto} method}{

It tries to select the appropriate method based on the two graphs.
This is the algorithm it uses:
\enumerate{
  \item If the two graphs do not agree on their order and size
    (i.e. number of vertices and edges), then return \code{FALSE}.
  \item If the graphs have three or four vertices, then the
    \sQuote{direct} method is used.
  \item If the graphs are directed, then the \sQuote{vf2} method is
    used.
  \item Otherwise the \sQuote{bliss} method is used.
}
}

\section{\sQuote{direct} method}{

This method only works on graphs with three or four vertices,
and it is based on a pre-calculated and stored table. It does not
have any extra arguments.
}

\section{\sQuote{vf2} method}{

This method uses the VF2 algorithm by Cordella, Foggia et al., see
references below. It supports vertex and edge colors and have the
following extra arguments:
\describe{
  \item{vertex.color1, vertex.color2}{Optional integer vectors giving the
    colors of the vertices for colored graph isomorphism. If they
    are not given, but the graph has a \dQuote{color} vertex attribute,
    then it will be used. If you want to ignore these attributes, then
    supply \code{NULL} for both of these arguments. See also examples
    below.}
  \item{edge.color1, edge.color2}{Optional integer vectors giving the
    colors of the edges for edge-colored (sub)graph isomorphism. If they
    are not given, but the graph has a \dQuote{color} edge attribute,
    then it will be used. If you want to ignore these attributes, then
    supply \code{NULL} for both of these arguments.}
}
}

\section{\sQuote{bliss} method}{

Uses the BLISS algorithm by Junttila and Kaski, and it works for
undirected graphs. For both graphs the
\code{\link{canonical_permutation}} and then the \code{\link{permute}}
function is called to transfer them into canonical form; finally the
canonical forms are compared.
Extra arguments:
\describe{
  \item{sh1}{Character constant, the heuristics to use in the BLISS
    algorithm, for \code{graph1}. See the \code{sh} argument of
    \code{\link{canonical_permutation}} for possible values.}
  \item{sh2}{Character constant, the heuristics to use in the BLISS
    algorithm, for \code{graph2}. See the \code{sh} argument of
    \code{\link{canonical_permutation}} for possible values.}
}
\code{sh1} and \code{sh2} default to \sQuote{fm}.
