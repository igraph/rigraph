\title{Kleinberg's hub and authority centrality scores.}
\usage{
hits_scores(
  graph,
  ...,
  scale = TRUE,
  weights = NULL,
  options = arpack_defaults()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{scale}{Logical scalar, whether to scale the result to have a maximum
score of one. If no scaling is used then the result vector has unit length
in the Euclidean norm.}

\item{weights}{Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
scores. If the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute, then this is used
by default.
This function interprets edge weights as connection strengths. In the
random surfer model, an edge with a larger weight is more likely to be
selected by the surfer.}

\item{options}{A named list, to override some ARPACK options. See
\code{\link[=arpack]{arpack()}} for details.}
}
\value{
A named list with members:
\item{hub}{The hub score of the vertices.}
\item{authority}{The authority score of the vertices.}
\item{value}{The corresponding eigenvalue of the calculated
principal eigenvector.}
\item{options}{Some information about the ARPACK computation, it has
the same members as the \code{options} member returned
by \code{\link[=arpack]{arpack()}}, see that for documentation.}
}
\description{
The hub scores of the vertices are defined as the principal eigenvector
of \eqn{A A^T}{A*t(A)}, where \eqn{A} is the adjacency matrix of the
graph.
}
\details{
Similarly, the authority scores of the vertices are defined as the principal
eigenvector of \eqn{A^T A}{t(A)*A}, where \eqn{A} is the adjacency matrix of
the graph.

For undirected matrices the adjacency matrix is symmetric and the hub
scores are the same as authority scores.

## An in-star
g <- make_star(10)
