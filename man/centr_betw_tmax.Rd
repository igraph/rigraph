\title{Theoretical maximum for betweenness centralization}
\usage{
centr_betw_tmax(graph = NULL, nodes = 0, directed = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph. It can also be \code{NULL} if
\code{nodes} and \code{directed} are both given.}

\item{nodes}{The number of vertices. This is ignored if the graph is
given.}

\item{directed}{Logical scalar, whether to use directed shortest paths
for calculating betweenness. Ignored if an undirected graph was
given.}
}
\value{
Real scalar, the theoretical maximum (unnormalized) graph
betweenness centrality score for graphs with given order and other
parameters.
}
\description{
See \code{\link[=centralize]{centralize()}} for a summary of graph centralization.
