\usage{
embed_adjacency_matrix(
  graph,
  no,
  weights = NULL,
  which = c("lm", "la", "sa"),
  scaled = TRUE,
  cvec = strength(graph, weights = weights)/(vcount(graph) - 1),
  options = arpack_defaults()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph, directed or undirected.}

\item{no}{An integer scalar. This value is the embedding dimension of the
spectral embedding. Should be smaller than the number of vertices. The
largest \code{no}-dimensional non-zero singular values are used for the
spectral embedding.}

\item{weights}{Optional positive weight vector for calculating a weighted
embedding. If the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute, then this is
used by default. In a weighted embedding, the edge weights are used instead
of the binary adjacencny matrix.}

\item{which}{Which eigenvalues (or singular values, for directed graphs) to
use. \sQuote{lm} means the ones with the largest magnitude, \sQuote{la} is
the ones (algebraic) largest, and \sQuote{sa} is the (algebraic) smallest
eigenvalues. The default is \sQuote{lm}. Note that for directed graphs
\sQuote{la} and \sQuote{lm} are the equivalent, because the singular values
are used for the ordering.}

\item{scaled}{Logical scalar, if \code{FALSE}, then \eqn{U} and \eqn{V} are
returned instead of \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y}.}

\item{cvec}{A numeric vector, its length is the number vertices in the
graph. This vector is added to the diagonal of the adjacency matrix.}

\item{options}{A named list containing the parameters for the SVD
computation algorithm in ARPACK. By default, the list of values is assigned
the values given by \code{\link[=arpack_defaults]{arpack_defaults()}}.}
}
\value{
A list containing with entries: \item{X}{Estimated latent positions,
an \code{n} times \code{no} matrix, \code{n} is the number of vertices.}
\item{Y}{\code{NULL} for undirected graphs, the second half of the latent
positions for directed graphs, an \code{n} times \code{no} matrix, \code{n}
is the number of vertices.} \item{D}{The eigenvalues (for undirected graphs)
or the singular values (for directed graphs) calculated by the algorithm.}
\item{options}{A named list, information about the underlying ARPACK
computation. See \code{\link[=arpack]{arpack()}} for the details.}

\description{
Spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrices of graphs.
}
\details{
This function computes a \code{no}-dimensional Euclidean representation of
the graph based on its adjacency matrix, \eqn{A}. This representation is
computed via the singular value decomposition of the adjacency matrix,
\eqn{A=UDV^T}.In the case, where the graph is a random dot product graph
generated using latent position vectors in \eqn{R^{no}} for each vertex, the
embedding will provide an estimate of these latent vectors.

For undirected graphs the latent positions are calculated as
\eqn{X=U^{no}D^{1/2}}{U[no] sqrt(D[no])}, where \eqn{U^{no}}{U[no]} equals
to the first \code{no} columns of \eqn{U}, and \eqn{D^{1/2}}{sqrt(D[no])} is
a diagonal matrix containing the top \code{no} singular values on the
diagonal.

For directed graphs the embedding is defined as the pair
\eqn{X=U^{no}D^{1/2}}{U[no] sqrt(D[no])} and \eqn{Y=V^{no}D^{1/2}}{V[no]
sqrt(D[no])}. (For undirected graphs \eqn{U=V}, so it is enough to keep one
of them.)

## A small graph
lpvs <- matrix(rnorm(200), 20, 10)
lpvs <- apply(lpvs, 2, function(x) {
  return(abs(x) / sqrt(sum(x^2)))
})
