\title{Functions to find cliques, ie. complete subgraphs in a graph}
\usage{
cliques(graph, min = 0, max = 0)

max_cliques(graph, min = NULL, max = NULL, subset = NULL, file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph, directed graphs will be considered as
undirected ones, multiple edges and loops are ignored.}

\item{min}{Numeric constant, lower limit on the size of the cliques to find.
\code{NULL} means no limit, ie. it is the same as 0.}

\item{max}{Numeric constant, upper limit on the size of the cliques to find.
\code{NULL} means no limit.}

\item{subset}{If not \code{NULL}, then it must be a vector of vertex ids,
numeric or symbolic if the graph is named. The algorithm is run from these
vertices only, so only a subset of all maximal cliques is returned. See the
Eppstein paper for details. This argument makes it possible to easily
parallelize the finding of maximal cliques.}

\item{file}{If not \code{NULL}, then it must be a file name, i.e. a
character scalar. The output of the algorithm is written to this file. (If
it exists, then it will be overwritten.) Each clique will be a separate line
in the file, given with the numeric ids of its vertices, separated by
whitespace.}
}
\value{
\code{cliques()}, \code{largest_cliques()} and \code{clique_num()}
return a list containing numeric vectors of vertex ids. Each list element is
a clique, i.e. a vertex sequence of class \code{\link[=V]{igraph.vs()}}.

\code{max_cliques()} returns \code{NULL}, invisibly, if its \code{file}
argument is not \code{NULL}. The output is written to the specified file in
this case.

\code{clique_num()} and \code{count_max_cliques()} return an integer
scalar.

\code{clique_size_counts()} returns a numeric vector with the clique sizes such that
the i-th item belongs to cliques of size i. Trailing zeros are currently
truncated, but this might change in future versions.
}
\description{
These functions find all, the largest or all the maximal cliques in an
undirected graph. The size of the largest clique can also be calculated.
}
\details{
\code{cliques()} find all complete subgraphs in the input graph, obeying the
size limitations given in the \code{min} and \code{max} arguments.

\code{largest_cliques()} finds all largest cliques in the input graph. A
clique is largest if there is no other clique including more vertices.

\code{max_cliques()} finds all maximal cliques in the input graph.  A
clique is maximal if it cannot be extended to a larger clique. The largest
cliques are always maximal, but a maximal clique is not necessarily the
largest.

\code{count_max_cliques()} counts the maximal cliques.

\code{clique_num()} calculates the size of the largest clique(s).

\code{clique_size_counts()} returns a numeric vector representing a histogram
of clique sizes, between the given minimum and maximum clique size.

\examples{

# this usually contains cliques of size six
g <- sample_gnp(100, 0.3)
clique_num(g)
cliques(g, min = 6)
largest_cliques(g)

# To have a bit less maximal cliques, about 100-200 usually
g <- sample_gnp(100, 0.03)
max_cliques(g)
}
