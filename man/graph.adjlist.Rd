\title{Create graphs from adjacency lists}
\usage{
graph.adjlist(adjlist, mode = c("out", "in", "all", "total"), duplicate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{adjlist}{The adjacency list. It should be consistent, i.e. the maximum
throughout all vectors in the list must be less than the number of vectors
(=the number of vertices in the graph).}

\item{mode}{Character scalar, it specifies whether the graph to create is
undirected (\sQuote{all} or \sQuote{total}) or directed; and in the latter
case, whether it contains the outgoing (\sQuote{out}) or the incoming
(\sQuote{in}) neighbors of the vertices.}

\item{duplicate}{Logical scalar. For undirected graphs it gives whether
edges are included in the list twice. E.g. if it is \code{TRUE} then for an
undirected \code{{A,B}} edge \code{graph_from_adj_list()} expects \code{A}
included in the neighbors of \code{B} and \code{B} to be included in the
neighbors of \code{A}.

This argument is ignored if \code{mode} is \code{out} or \verb{in}.}

\code{graph.adjlist()} was renamed to \code{graph_from_adj_list()} to create a more
consistent API.
