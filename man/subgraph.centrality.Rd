\usage{
subgraph.centrality(graph, diag = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph. It will be treated as undirected.}

\item{diag}{Boolean scalar, whether to include the diagonal of the adjacency
matrix in the analysis. Giving \code{FALSE} here effectively eliminates the
loops edges from the graph before the calculation.}
