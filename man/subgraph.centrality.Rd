\title{Find subgraph centrality scores of network positions}
\usage{
subgraph.centrality(graph, diag = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph, it should be undirected, but the
implementation does not check this currently.}

\item{diag}{Boolean scalar, whether to include the diagonal of the adjacency
matrix in the analysis. Giving \code{FALSE} here effectively eliminates the
loops edges from the graph before the calculation.}
