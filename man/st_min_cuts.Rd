\title{List all minimum \eqn{(s,t)}-cuts of a graph}
\usage{
st_min_cuts(graph, source, target, capacity = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph. It must be directed.}

\item{source}{The id of the source vertex.}

\item{target}{The id of the target vertex.}

\item{capacity}{Numeric vector giving the edge capacities. If this is
\code{NULL} and the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute, then this
attribute defines the edge capacities. For forcing unit edge capacities,
even for graphs that have a \code{weight} edge attribute, supply \code{NA}
here.}
}
\value{
A list with entries: \item{value}{Numeric scalar, the size of the
minimum cut(s).} \item{cuts}{A list of numeric vectors containing edge ids.
Each vector is a minimum \eqn{(s,t)}-cut.} \item{partition1s}{A list of
numeric vectors containing vertex ids, they correspond to the edge cuts.
Each vertex set is a generator of the corresponding cut, i.e. in the graph
\eqn{G=(V,E)}, the vertex set \eqn{X} and its complementer \eqn{V-X},
generates the cut that contains exactly the edges that go from \eqn{X} to
\eqn{V-X}.}

\description{
Listing all minimum \eqn{(s,t)}-cuts of a directed graph, for given \eqn{s}
and \eqn{t}.
}
\details{
Given a \eqn{G} directed graph and two, different and non-ajacent vertices,
\eqn{s} and \eqn{t}, an \eqn{(s,t)}-cut is a set of edges, such that after
removing these edges from \eqn{G} there is no directed path from \eqn{s} to
\eqn{t}.

The size of an \eqn{(s,t)}-cut is defined as the sum of the capacities (or
weights) in the cut. For unweighted (=equally weighted) graphs, this is
simply the number of edges.

An \eqn{(s,t)}-cut is minimum if it is of the smallest possible size.
