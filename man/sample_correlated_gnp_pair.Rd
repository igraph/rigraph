\title{Sample a pair of correlated \eqn{G(n,p)} random graphs}
\usage{
sample_correlated_gnp_pair(n, corr, p, directed = FALSE, permutation = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Numeric scalar, the number of vertices for the sampled graphs.}

\item{corr}{A scalar in the unit interval, the target Pearson correlation
between the adjacency matrices of the original the generated graph (the
adjacency matrix being used as a vector).}

\item{p}{A numeric scalar, the probability of an edge between two vertices,
it must in the open (0,1) interval.}

\item{directed}{Logical scalar, whether to generate directed graphs.}

\item{permutation}{A numeric vector, a permutation vector that is applied on
the vertices of the first graph, to get the second graph.  If \code{NULL},
the vertices are not permuted.}
}
\value{
A list of two igraph objects, named \code{graph1} and
\code{graph2}, which are two graphs whose adjacency matrix entries are
correlated with \code{corr}.
}
\description{
Sample a new graph by perturbing the adjacency matrix of a given graph and
shuffling its vertices.
