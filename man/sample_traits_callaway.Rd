\arguments{
\item{nodes}{The number of vertices in the graph.}

\item{types}{The number of different vertex types.}

\item{edge.per.step}{The number of edges to add to the graph per time step.}

\item{type.dist}{The distribution of the vertex types. This is assumed to be
stationary in time.}

\item{pref.matrix}{A matrix giving the preferences of the given vertex
types. These should be probabilities, ie. numbers between zero and one.}

\item{directed}{Logical constant, whether to generate directed graphs.}

\item{...}{Passed to the constructor, \code{sample_traits()} or
\code{sample_traits_callaway()}.}

\item{k}{The number of trials per time step, see details below.}
}
\value{
A new graph object.
}
\description{
These functions implement evolving network models based on different vertex
types.
}
\details{
For \code{sample_traits_callaway()} the simulation goes like this: in each
discrete time step a new vertex is added to the graph. The type of this
vertex is generated based on \code{type.dist}. Then two vertices are
selected uniformly randomly from the graph. The probability that they will
be connected depends on the types of these vertices and is taken from
\code{pref.matrix}. Then another two vertices are selected and this is
repeated \code{edges.per.step} times in each time step.

For \code{sample_traits()} the simulation goes like this: a single vertex is
added at each time step. This new vertex tries to connect to \code{k}
vertices in the graph. The probability that such a connection is realized
depends on the types of the vertices involved and is taken from
\code{pref.matrix}.

\examples{

# two types of vertices, they like only themselves
g1 <- sample_traits_callaway(1000, 2, pref.matrix = matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), ncol = 2))
g2 <- sample_traits(1000, 2, k = 2, pref.matrix = matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), ncol = 2))
