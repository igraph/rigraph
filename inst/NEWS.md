# igraph 1.2.1

- The GLPK library is optional, if it is not available, then the
  `cluster_optimal()` function does not work. Unfortunately we cannot
  bundle the GLPK library into igraph on CRAN any more, because CRAN
  maintainers forbid the pragmas in its source code.
- Removed the NMF package dependency, and related functions.
- Fix compilation without libxml2

# igraph 1.1.2

Jul 20, 2017

- Fix compilation on Solaris


# igraph 1.1.1

Jul 13, 2017

- Graph id is printed in the header, and a `graph_id` function was added
- Fix `edge_attr` for some index values
- Fix a `bfs()` bug, `restricted` argument was zero-based
- `match_vertices` is exported now
- `%>%` is re-exported in a better way, to avoid interference with other
  packages
- `ego_` functions default to `order = 1` now
- New function `igraph_with_opt` to run code with temporary igraph
  options settings
- Fix broken `sample_asym_pref` function
- Fix `curve_multiple` to avoid warnings for graphs with self-loops.
- The `NMF` package is only suggested now, it is not a hard
  dependency
- Fix gen_uid.c _SVID_SOURCE issues
- Avoid drawing straight lines as Bezier curves
- Use the `pkgconfig` package for options. This allows setting options
  on a per-package basis. E.g. a package using igraph can set `return.vs.es`
  to `FALSE` in its `.onLoad()` function, and then igraph will return
  plain numeric vectors instead of vertex/edge sequences
  *if called from this package*.
- `igraph_options()` returns the *old* values of the updated options,
  this is actually useful, returning the new values was not.
- `with_igraph_opt()` function to temporarily change values of
  igraph options.
- `get.edge()` is deprecated, use `ends()` instead. (This was already the case
  for igraph 1.0.0, but we forgot to add a NEWS point for it.)
- Do not redefine `.Call()`, to make native calls faster.
- Speed up special cases of indexing vertex sequences.
- Removed an `anyNA()` call, to be compatible with older R versions.
- Fixed a fast-greedy community finding bug,
  https://github.com/igraph/igraph/issues/836
- Fixed `head_of()` and `tail_of()`, they were mixed up.
- Plot: make `label.dist` independent of label lengths, fixes #63.
- Plot: no error for unknown graphical parameters.
- Import functions from base packages, to eliminate
  `R CMD check` `NOTE`s.
- Readd support for edge weights in Fruchterman-Reingold layout
- Check membershiph vector in `modularity()`.
- Rename `str.igraph()` to `print_all()`.
- Use the igraph version in exported graphs, instread of @VERSION@ #75.
- Functions that can be used inside a `V()` or `E()` indexing
  now begin with a dot. Old names are deprecated.
  New names: `.nei()`, `.innei()`, `.outnei()`, `.inc()`, `.from()`,
  `.to()`. #22
- Fix packages that convert graphs to graph::graphNEL: they
  don't need to attach 'graph' manually any more.
- Fix a bugs in `layout_with_dh`, `layout_with_gem` and
  `layout_with_sugiyama`. They crashed in some cases.

# igraph 1.0.1

June 26, 2015

Some minor updates:

- Documentation fixes.
- Do not require a C++-11 compiler any more.
- Fedora, Solaris and Windows compilation fixes.

# igraph 1.0.0

June 21, 2015

## Release notes

This is a new major version of igraph, and then why not call
it 1.0.0. This does not mean that it is ready, it'll never be
ready.

The biggest changes in the release are
- the new function names. Most functions were renamed to
  make them more consistent and readable. (Relax, old names
  can still be used, no need to update any code.)
- Better operations for vertex and edge sequences. Most functions
  return proper vertex/edge sequences instead of numeric ids.
- The versatile `make_()` and `make_graph()` functions to
  create graphs.

## Major changes

- Many functions were renamed. Old names are not documented,
  but can still be used.
- A generic `make_graph()` function to create graphs.
- A generic `layout_()` (not the underscore!) function
  to create graph layouts, see also `add_layout_()`.
- The igraph data type has changed. You need to call
  `upgrade_graph()` on graphs created with previous igraph
  versions.
- Vertex and edge sequence operations: union, intersection, etc.
- Vertex and edge sequences can only be used with the graphs they
  belong to. This is now strictly checked.
- Most functions that return a (sub)set of vertices
  or edges return vertex or edge sequences instead.
- Vertex and edge sequences have a `[[` operator now,
  for easy viewing of vertex/edge metadata.
- Vertex and edge sequences are implemented as weak references.
  See also the `as_ids()` function to convert them to simple ids.
- Vertex order can be specified for the circle layout now.
- Davidson-Harel layout algorithm `layout_with_dh()`.
- GEM layout algorithm `layout_with_gem()`.
- Neighborhood functions have a `mindist` parameter for the
  smallest distance to consider.
- `all_simple_paths()` function to list all simple paths in a graph.
- `triangles()` lists all triangles in a graph.
- Fruchterman-Reingold and Kamada-Kawai layout algorithms
  rewritten from scratch. They are much faster and follow the
  original publications closely.
- Nicer printing of graphs, vertex and edge sequences.
- `local_scan()` function calculates scan statistics.
- Embeddings: `embed_adjacency_matrix()` and `embed_laplacian_matrix()`.
- Product operator: `*`, the same graph multiple times. Can be also
  used as `rep()`.
- Better default colors, color palettes for vertices.
- Random walk on a graph: `random_walk()`
- `adjacenct_vertices()` and `incident_edges()` functions,
  they are vectorized, as opposed to `neighhors()` and `incident()`.
- Convert a graph to a _long_ data frame with `as_long_data_frame()`.

## Bug fixes

Too many to list. Please try if your issue was fixed and (re-)report
it if not. Thanks!

announced officially. The place for reporting bugs is
at https://github.com/igraph/igraph/issues.

### New homepage

igraph's homepage is now hosted at http://igraph.org, and it is
brand new. We wanted to make it easier to use and modern.

Released May 16, 2013

Worked two CRAN check problems, and a gfortran bug (string bound
checking does not work if code is called from C and without string
length arguments at the "right" place).

Otherwise identical to 0.6.5-1.

# igraph 0.6.5-1

Released February 27, 2013

  lists or other complex objects.

# igraph 0.6.5

Released February 24, 2013

This is a minor release, to fix some very annoying bugs in 0.6.4:

- igraph should now work well with older R versions.

Released February 2, 2013

The version number is not a mistake, we jump to 0.6.4 from 0.6,
for technical reasons. This version was actually never really
released, but some R packages of this version were uplodaded to
CRAN, so we include this version in this NEW file.

# igraph 0.6

Released June 11, 2012

See also the release notes at
http://igraph.sf.net/relnotes-0.6.html

# R: Major new features

- Vertices and edges are numbered from 1 instead of 0.
  Note that this makes most of the old R igraph code incompatible
  with igraph 0.6. If you want to use your old code, please use
  the igraph0 package. See more at http://igraph.sf.net/relnotes-0.6.html.
- The '[' and '[[' operators can now be used on igraph graphs,
  for '[' the graph behaves as an adjacency matrix, for '[[' is
  is treated as an adjacency list. It is also much simpler to
  manipulate the graph structure, i.e. add/remove edges and vertices,
  with some new operators. See more at ?graph.structure.
- In all functions that take a vector or list of vertices or edges,
  vertex/edge names can be given instead of the numeric ids.
- New package 'igraphdata', contains a number of data sets that can
  be used directly in igraph.
- Igraph now supports loading graphs from the Nexus online data
  repository, see nexus.get(), nexus.info(), nexus.list() and
  nexus.search().
- All the community structure finding algorithm return a 'communities'
  object now, which has a bunch of useful operations, see
  ?communities for details.
- Vertex and edge attributes are handled much better now. They
  are kept whenever possible, and can be combined via a flexible API.
  See ?attribute.combination.
- R now prints igraph graphs to the screen in a more structured and
  informative way. The output of summary() was also updated
  accordingly.

# R: Other new features

- It is possible to mark vertex groups on plots, via
  shading. Communities and cohesive blocks are plotted using this by
  default.
- Some igraph demos are now available, see a list via
  'demo(package="igraph")'.
- igraph now tries to select the optimal layout algorithm, when
  plotting a graph.
- Added a simple console, using Tcl/Tk. It contains a text area
  for status messages and also a status bar. See igraph.console().
- Reimplemented igraph options support, see igraph.options() and
  getIgraphOpt().
- Igraph functions can now print status messages.

# R: New or updated functions

## Community detection

- The multi-level modularity optimization community structure detection
  algorithm by Blondel et al. was added, see multilevel.community().
- Distance between two community structures: compare.communities().

  optimal.community().
- Hierarchical random graphs and community finding, porting the code
  from Aaron Clauset. See hrg.game(), hrg.fit(), etc.
- Added the InfoMAP community finding method, thanks to Emmanuel
  Navarro for the code. See infomap.community().

## Shortest paths

- Eccentricity (eccentricity()), and radius (radius()) calculations.
- Shortest path calculations with get.shortest.paths() can now
  return the edges along the shortest paths.

  edge weights now.
- Support edge weights in betweenness and closeness calculations.
- bonpow(), Bonacich's power centrality and alpha.centrality(),
  Alpha centrality calculations now use sparse matrices by default.
- Eigenvector centrality calculation, evcent() now works for
  directed graphs.
- Betweenness calculation can now use arbitrarily large integers,
  this is required for some lattice-like graphs to avoid overflow.

## Input/output and file formats

- Support the DL file format in graph.read(). See
  http://www.analytictech.com/networks/dataentry.htm.
- Support writing the LEDA file format in write.graph().

## Plotting and layouts

- Star layout: layout.star().
- Layout based on multidimensional scaling, layout.mds().
- New layouts layout.grid() and layout.grid.3d().
- Sugiyama layout algorithm for layered directed acyclic graphs,
  layout.sugiyama().

## Graph generators

- New graph generators: static.fitness.game(), static.power.law.game().
- barabasi.game() was rewritten and it supports three algorithms now,
  the default algorithm does not generate multiple or loop edges.
  The graph generation process can now start from a supplied graph.
- The Watts-Strogatz graph generator, igraph_watts_strogatz() can
  now create graphs without loop edges.

## Others

- Added the Spectral Coarse Graining algorithm, see scg().
- The cohesive.blocks() function was rewritten in C, it is much faster
  now. It has a nicer API, too. See demo("cohesive").
- Added generic breadth-first and depth-first search implementations
  with many callbacks, graph.bfs() and graph_dfs().
- Support vertex and edge coloring in the VF2 (sub)graph isomorphism
  functions (graph.isomorphic.vf2(), graph.count.isomorphisms.vf2(),
  graph.get.isomorphisms.vf2(), graph.subisomorphic.vf2(),
  graph.count.subisomorphisms.vf2(), graph.get.subisomorphisms.vf2()).
- Assortativity coefficient, assortativity(), assortativity.nominal()
  and assortativity.degree().
- Vertex operators that work by vertex names:
  graph.intersection.by.name(), graph.union.by.name(),
  graph.difference.by.name(). Thanks to Magnus Torfason for
  contributing his code!
- Function to calculate a non-induced subraph: subgraph.edges().
- More comprehensive maximum flow and minimum cut calculation,
  see functions graph.maxflow(), graph.mincut(), stCuts(), stMincuts().
- Check whether a directed graph is a DAG, is.dag().
- has.multiple() to decide whether a graph has multiple edges.
- Added a function to calculate a diversity score for the vertices,
  graph.diversity().
- Graph Laplacian calculation (graph.laplacian()) supports edge
  weights now.
- Biconnected component calculation, biconnected.components()
  now returns the components themselves.
- bipartite.projection() calculates multiplicity of edges.
- Maximum cardinality search: maximum.cardinality.search() and
  chordality test: is.chordal()
- Convex hull computation, convex.hull().
- Contract vertices, contract.vertices().

# igraph 0.5.1

Released July 14, 2008

See also the release notes at
http://igraph.sf.net/relnotes-0.5.1.html

## New in the R interface

- A new layout generator called DrL.
- Uniform sampling of random connected undirected graphs with a
  given degree sequence.
- Edge labels are plotted at 1/3 of the edge, this is better if
  the graph has mutual edges.
- Initial and experimental vertex shape support in 'plot'.
- New function, 'graph.adjlist' creates igraph graphs from
  adjacency lists.
- Conversion to/from graphNEL graphs, from the 'graph' R package.
- Fastgreedy community detection can utilize edge weights now, this
  was missing from the R interface.
- The 'arrow.width' graphical parameter was added.
- graph.data.frame has a new argument 'vertices'.
- graph.adjacency and get.adjacency support sparse matrices,
  the 'Matrix' package is required to use this functionality.
- graph.adjacency adds column/row names as 'name' attribute.
- Weighted shortest paths using Dijkstra's or the Belmann-Ford
  algorithm.
- Shortest path functions return 'Inf' for unreachable vertices.
- New function 'is.mutual' to find mutual edges in a directed graph.
- Added inverse log-weighted similarity measure (a.k.a. Adamic/Adar
  similarity).
- preference.game and asymmetric.preference.game were
  rewritten, they are O(|V|+|E|) now, instead of O(|V|^2).
- Edge weight support in function 'get.shortest.paths', it uses
  Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Bugs corrected in the R interface

- A bug was corrected in write.pajek.bgraph.
- Several bugs were corrected in graph.adjacency.
- Pajek reader bug corrected, used to segfault if '*Vertices'
  was missing.
- Directedness is handled correctly when writing GML files.
  (But note that 'correct' conflicts the standard here.)
- Corrected a bug when calculating weighted, directed PageRank on an
  undirected graph. (Which does not make sense anyway.)
- Several bugs were fixed in the Reingold-Tilford layout to avoid
  edge crossings.
- A bug was fixed in the GraphML reader, when the value of a graph
  attribute was not specified.
- Fixed a bug in the graph isomorphism routine for small (3-4 vertices)
  graphs.
- Corrected the random sampling implementation (igraph_random_sample),
  now it always generates unique numbers. This affects the
  Gnm Erdos-Renyi generator, it always generates simple graphs now.
- The basic igraph constructor (igraph_empty_attrs, all functions
  are expected to call this internally) now checks whether the number
  of vertices is finite.
- The LGL, NCOL and Pajek graph readers handle errors properly now.

better.

# igraph 0.1

Released Jan 30, 2006

After about a year of development this is the first "official" release
of the igraph library. This release should be considered as beta
software, but it should be useful in general. Please send your
questions and comments.
